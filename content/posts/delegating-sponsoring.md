Many times as a Software Engineer you might have realized you grown your toolset of skills and feel you deserve a promotion. However, during the promotion cycle, your manager gave you feedback that for you to get promoted you need to grow others around you. This statement might have puzzled you, since when has your performance as an individual contributor had anything to do with other people? It is called the Individual Contributor path for a reason, no?

While you may excel in your technical skills and abilities, it's important to remember that most software engineering positions involve working with a team. Collaboration between developers, product managers, and designers can lead to better products and make you a valuable member of the team.

## Teamwork Series

We can define Software Engineering as the union of people, processes, and products to enable the continuous delivery of value to our end users. There can be no promotion if the team does not grow with it.

"Teamwork" is a series of posts where I will be sharing my learnings from topics surrounding working with teams like [Team Cohesion](/posts/teamwork-collaboration), [Coaching and Mentoring](/posts/mentoring-coaching-sponsorship), [Delegating and Sponsoring](/posts/delegating-sponsoring), and others from the perspective of an Engineering Manager. These tools will allow you to support and lead your tech team grow with you.

## Delegating and Sponsoring

In the dynamic world of software engineering, effective leadership transcends beyond just managing tasks and projects. It involves mastering the arts of delegation and sponsorship -- two pivotal skills that can significantly enhance team performance, foster professional growth, and drive innovation.

Understanding when and how to delegate tasks, as well as how to sponsor and advocate for your team members, can set you apart as a leader in the tech industry. Delegation and sponsorship share some similarities in their focus on developing team members and enhancing team performance, but they also have distinct differences in their approach and objectives.

## Delegating
Delegation is more than just assigning tasks; it's entrusting responsibility and authority to team members to complete those tasks. It's a strategic tool that enables leaders to manage their workload more efficiently, while simultaneously empowering team members, enhancing their skills, and fostering a sense of trust and accountability within the team.

Delegation empowers team members by entrusting them with important tasks, which boosts their confidence and engagement. It allows team members to develop new skills and expertise, preparing them for more significant roles in the future. And by delegating, leaders can distribute workloads more evenly, ensuring that tasks are completed by those with the most appropriate skills and bandwidth.

### Delegate Effectively

Effective delegation requires choosing the right tasks to delegate, selecting the appropriate team members based on their skills and development needs, providing clear instructions, and offering support and feedback throughout the process.

- **Choose the Right Tasks:** Not all tasks are suitable for delegation. Choose tasks that contribute to team members' growth and are aligned with their skills and career aspirations.
- **Select the Right People:** Consider the skills, interests, and developmental needs of your team members when delegating tasks.
- **Provide Clear Expectations:** Clearly communicate the task objectives, deadlines, and any relevant information to ensure understanding and alignment.
- **Empower with Authority:** Ensure that team members have the authority and resources they need to complete the task successfully.
Monitor Progress and Provide Feedback: Check in periodically to monitor progress, offer guidance, and provide constructive feedback.

## Sponsorship
Sponsorship goes beyond mentorship; it involves actively advocating for and investing in the professional development of team members. A sponsor not only offers guidance and support but also uses their influence to open doors and create opportunities for those they sponsor.

Sponsors use their influence to open doors, provide high-profile opportunities, and ensure that the accomplishments and potential of the individuals they support are recognized at decision-making levels.

Sponsorship can play a critical role in the career advancement of team members by providing them with visibility and opportunities. Feeling supported and having clear career advancement opportunities can significantly improve team member retention. Effective sponsorship can help break down barriers and promote diversity and inclusion within leadership roles.

### Sponsor Effectively

This role is crucial for career development and often involves a personal commitment to the sponsored individual's success, making it a powerful tool for promoting talent within the organization, especially for underrepresented groups.

- **Identify Talent:** Look for team members who show potential, commitment, and a drive to grow within the company.
- **Provide Opportunities:** Offer challenging projects, introduce them to key stakeholders, and involve them in high-visibility tasks.
- **Advocate:** Use your influence to advocate for your protégés, recommending them for promotions, recognitions, and important assignments.
- **Offer Guidance:** Provide constructive feedback and advice to help them navigate their career paths and professional challenges.
- **Support Their Visibility:** Ensure that the achievements and potential of those you sponsor are visible to senior leadership.

## Differences
Though both delegation and sponsorship aim to develop team members and enhance team performance, they differ in several key aspects:

- **Scope and Focus:** Delegation is task-oriented; it's about assigning specific tasks or projects to team members. Sponsorship is relationship-oriented, focusing on the long-term career development of the individual and often involves a personal commitment to their success.

- **Level of Involvement:** In delegation, once a task is assigned, the leader typically steps back, providing guidance and support as needed but allowing the team member to take ownership. In sponsorship, the leader is actively involved in advocating for the individual's career advancement, which includes creating opportunities and promoting their achievements within the organization.

- **Visibility:** Delegation primarily operates within the context of the team or project, with the delegated tasks and outcomes being visible to the immediate team or department. Sponsorship aims to increase the individual's visibility on a broader scale, often involving senior leadership and decision-makers across the organization.

- **Objective:** The primary objective of delegation is to enhance efficiency and team capability, ensuring that the right tasks are matched with the right skills, and leaders can focus on strategic areas. Sponsorship, however, is primarily focused on advancing the individual's career, helping them to secure promotions, gain new experiences, and enhance their professional network.

# Conclusion

As a leader in software engineering, balancing delegation and sponsorship is key to developing a high-performing, motivated, and loyal team. Delegation helps in building a self-reliant team capable of handling tasks with minimal supervision, while sponsorship ensures team members have the opportunities and support they need to advance their careers.

By mastering these two essential skills, you not only enhance your leadership capabilities but also contribute to creating an empowering and inclusive work environment that values growth, innovation, and diversity. Remember, the success of your team is a reflection of your success as a leader.
