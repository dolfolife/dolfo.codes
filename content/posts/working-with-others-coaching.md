Driving like testing
Deliver things
Optimal route 
Driving is enough complicated to keep you busy so you decide to find help
And you find a partner for your team but you still accountable and responsible for the work
Then you let them drive and teach them everything you know about how to drive in the city...
You start telling them exactly when to turn and what streets to take depending of several factors like traffic. But you realize you still have to plan other delivery and your time is not gaining enough time to expand

 With every delivery you start trusting them where to go and you only tell them the destination and go back to the rest of the deliveries and plan the best route plan.

At some point you don't need to be in the car anymore and lend them drive it in full autonomy and now you are the one telling them about the deliveries and the cycle repeats. 

What would you do if you need to teach them how to drive? How would do it?
That is couching and managing a team...

We have tools like gps and maps to guide us but sometimes personal experience of a copilot helps you increase your growth 

Sometimes the person who is going to help you doesn't know how to drive
This is when you need to enter in basic learning mode...

what you can do about it.
