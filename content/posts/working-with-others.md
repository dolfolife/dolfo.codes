This is "Working With Others" a series of posts where I will be writing about working with others with analogies.

You are a Software Engineer with a lot of skills in your toolset, and you feel you deserve a promotion. During the promotion cycle, your manager has feedback for you. They mention that to get promoted you need to grow others around you. You are puzzled by this, since _when_ your performance as an individual contributor has anything to do with other people. It is called the Individual Contributor path for a reason, no? 

The reality is that the only environment where you might work alone is hacking something at home or as a self-employed. Otherwise, you are probably always working with a team during your career as a Software Engineer. You will interact with the members of that team and anyone who interacts with your team in the organization. You build products together using principles and processes everyone agrees on. We can define Software Engineering as the union of people, processes, and products to enable the continuous delivery of value to our end users. To do this well, you need to bring the team with you on your career journey. There is no promotion if the team does not grow with it.

To explain myself I will use the analogy where your job is to get to places and deliver packages. Let's say you are a driver, the software engineer part, and your goals are routes in a map you must follow to deliver packages, the product.

You start by learning how to drive at your company either by following other drivers or reading the map of the place. Most of the time, the organization will assign a copilot to your car to teach you the way. Even at the start of your driver career, you have someone to work with. But this time is different, They will coach you about the optimal routes you need to learn to drive around with ease. After a few trips at your job, the team feels you can drive yourself pretty easily with no copilot. You start driving and getting to places alone. 

Your boss starts giving you more complicated routes where the optimal route changes dynamically because of traffic and weather. you only check the path at the beginning of the drive and the end. You realize a copilot could help you deliver more packages efficiently. When you talk with your manager they tell you that for these complicated routes, they will pair you with a junior driver so you can coach them while you optimize the work ahead and get to destinations on time. At this point, you are confused. Your manager to help you be more efficient at your job just gave you more work to do; coaching a new driver. Not only that, they change your job from just driving to optimizing routes. The last words of your manager are "A senior driver can get around the city most of the time by choosing the optimal path and helping new drivers understand the place you work on".

After you are back at your desk, you make a list of the skills you might need to achieve this new task. To work with others and lift the team you need to learn to coach, mentor, delegate and lead. What an overwhelming list of new skills you need to add to make you a better driver and earn your promotion. You accept the challenge and take responsibility to learn what is needed.
