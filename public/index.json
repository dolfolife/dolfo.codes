The conversation around Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) seems to be very binary, either \u0026ldquo;force people to hire diversity no matter the cost\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;just hire the most qualified person.\u0026rdquo; In a domain where it is never black and white, this polarized approach feels wrong. Like every polarized conversation, it divides people, causing them to defend their positions and attack those who think differently. DEI plays a role in a very grey and biased ecosystem, which is hiring, and you cannot have polarized policies or opinions when it comes to who you are working with.\nDEI comes from the idea that a diverse group of experiences can yield better results when your job is to solve problems that affect all of us. My organization embedded it throughout the entire employee lifecycle—from hiring to promotion and raises. We trained ourselves to remove as much bias as we could to make the best decisions based on merit and skill. In software development, this strategy can be seen in how we consider disabilities, symbolism, and the organization of different points of view.\nI want to share my perspective, shaped by my own experience working within an organization that successfully embraced a thoughtful DEI framework. This is a delicate topic, but it’s one that benefits immensely from kindness and empathy.\nEliminating Bias, Not Lowering the Bar In my opinion, the true power of effective DEI programs is not to \u0026ldquo;quota\u0026rdquo; the teams you build, but to relentlessly expose and eliminate bias in the hiring teams themselves. DEI reduces bias by helping hiring teams pay attention to what really matters, not what feels more comfortable.\nWe cannot deny that it\u0026rsquo;s human nature to feel safer in spaces where there are people like us. When tasked with choosing a new colleague, the unconscious default is often to select someone who mirrors our own characteristics, especially if we fail to examine our own judgment biases.\nThe phrase \u0026ldquo;just hire the most qualified person\u0026rdquo; reveals to me a fundamental misunderstanding of the hiring process. Hiring is a very vague journey where the goal is to find a qualified person who can successfully do the job in a reasonable time, not magically identify the single \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; employee, particularly when the decision is filtered through a few hours of conversation with a handful of biased teammates.\nThis vague hiring process is where DEI plays a crucial role to eliminate biases as much as we can so that any candidate with the right skills is not disadvantaged by characteristics that might make them less appealing to the hiring team\u0026rsquo;s unconscious preferences. Since minorities are more likely to encounter this bias as problematic, DEI addresses this by reducing bias during the process.\nThe Business of Hiring: Acknowledging the Grey The hiring ecosystem is a mix of grey. The bright line that should never be crossed is where we lower the bar for hiring because we are not getting enough diversity in our interviewee groups. Hiring is also a business decision that should take into consideration skills and merit. I am sure people want to be hired based on their merit, not their identity—which has not changed since they were born.\nIf your hiring process is successful, you\u0026rsquo;ll often get multiple people who are qualified for the job. In this case, choosing randomly would yield a similar outcome to spending a lot more effort trying to determine who is marginally more qualified. This is also an opportunity to organize the team with the new hire in mind, introducing a member who will not only bring the required skills but also bridge experience gaps that exist in the team.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s be honest—a normal hiring process looks more like the secretary problem than choosing the local maximum.\nThe Representation Question Most people would agree that when we talk about fighting for more representation, we\u0026rsquo;re not talking about entry-level jobs but those roles that can really steer the ship of an organization. For the past few decades in tech, we have seen many of these positions filled by a specific group of people, leaving us with the question: \u0026ldquo;Is there a more diverse way to lead?\u0026rdquo;\nTo answer this, we need to dive deeper into the representation of individuals who studied tech 30 years ago, which was not very diverse. That distribution is compounded by the level of stress and endurance someone needs to have to rise to that level of leadership. These positions are not something I would be able to take on. In my opinion, these positions are too much for one person, but there are people willing to take them on and absorb the responsibilities that entail.\nI am hopeful that more diverse groups are coming out of universities and entering the job market, and we will see in 30 years a more diverse group of C-level executives and directors than we see today, improving the representation people are hoping for.\nMoving Forward with Kindness The need for robust DEI programs was created by decades of systemic and cultural trends in the workforce. We need to focus on understanding what happened and what is currently happening, rather than resorting to blame and pointing fingers.\nWe are a group of individuals with complex lives trying to find a space to explore our skills alongside other people who have their own complex lives. We can choose to be kind to each other. In my personal experience, more diverse teams tend to be more kind and understanding with others than teams where everyone shares the same background.\nDEI\u0026rsquo;s strength is not about forcing anyone to fill a quota of diversity. It\u0026rsquo;s about recognizing our human tendency to gravitate toward similarity and providing tools to ensure we\u0026rsquo;re making decisions based on skills, merit, and potential rather than unconscious comfort with familiarity.\nLet us commit to kindness, empathy, and the continuous, difficult work of reducing bias. When we do this, we don\u0026rsquo;t compromise merit. We clarify it, ensuring that true skill is what ultimately prevails.\nAlways be kind.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/dei-use-case/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI know this is a delicate topic to talk about, but I wanted to share my personal experience and opinion.

It is called the Individual Contributor path for a reason, no?\nWhile you may excel in your technical skills and abilities, it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember that most software engineering positions involve working with a team. Collaboration between developers, product managers, and designers can lead to better products and make you a valuable member of the team.\nTeamwork Series We can define Software Engineering as the union of people, processes, and products to enable the continuous delivery of value to our end users. There can be no promotion if the team does not grow with it.\n\u0026ldquo;Teamwork\u0026rdquo; is a series of posts where I will be sharing my learnings from topics surrounding working with teams like Team Cohesion, Coaching and Mentoring, Delegating and Sponsoring, and others from the perspective of an Engineering Manager. These tools will allow you to support and lead your tech team grow with you.\nDelegating and Sponsoring In the dynamic world of software engineering, effective leadership transcends beyond just managing tasks and projects. It involves mastering the arts of delegation and sponsorship \u0026ndash; two pivotal skills that can significantly enhance team performance, foster professional growth, and drive innovation.\nUnderstanding when and how to delegate tasks, as well as how to sponsor and advocate for your team members, can set you apart as a leader in the tech industry. Delegation and sponsorship share some similarities in their focus on developing team members and enhancing team performance, but they also have distinct differences in their approach and objectives.\nDelegating Delegation is more than just assigning tasks; it\u0026rsquo;s entrusting responsibility and authority to team members to complete those tasks. It\u0026rsquo;s a strategic tool that enables leaders to manage their workload more efficiently, while simultaneously empowering team members, enhancing their skills, and fostering a sense of trust and accountability within the team.\nDelegation empowers team members by entrusting them with important tasks, which boosts their confidence and engagement. It allows team members to develop new skills and expertise, preparing them for more significant roles in the future. And by delegating, leaders can distribute workloads more evenly, ensuring that tasks are completed by those with the most appropriate skills and bandwidth.\nDelegate Effectively Effective delegation requires choosing the right tasks to delegate, selecting the appropriate team members based on their skills and development needs, providing clear instructions, and offering support and feedback throughout the process.\nChoose the Right Tasks: Not all tasks are suitable for delegation. Choose tasks that contribute to team members\u0026rsquo; growth and are aligned with their skills and career aspirations. Select the Right People: Consider the skills, interests, and developmental needs of your team members when delegating tasks. Provide Clear Expectations: Clearly communicate the task objectives, deadlines, and any relevant information to ensure understanding and alignment. Empower with Authority: Ensure that team members have the authority and resources they need to complete the task successfully. Monitor Progress and Provide Feedback: Check in periodically to monitor progress, offer guidance, and provide constructive feedback. Sponsorship Sponsorship goes beyond mentorship; it involves actively advocating for and investing in the professional development of team members. A sponsor not only offers guidance and support but also uses their influence to open doors and create opportunities for those they sponsor.\nSponsors use their influence to open doors, provide high-profile opportunities, and ensure that the accomplishments and potential of the individuals they support are recognized at decision-making levels.\nSponsorship can play a critical role in the career advancement of team members by providing them with visibility and opportunities. Feeling supported and having clear career advancement opportunities can significantly improve team member retention. Effective sponsorship can help break down barriers and promote diversity and inclusion within leadership roles.\nSponsor Effectively This role is crucial for career development and often involves a personal commitment to the sponsored individual\u0026rsquo;s success, making it a powerful tool for promoting talent within the organization, especially for underrepresented groups.\nIdentify Talent: Look for team members who show potential, commitment, and a drive to grow within the company. Provide Opportunities: Offer challenging projects, introduce them to key stakeholders, and involve them in high-visibility tasks. Advocate: Use your influence to advocate for your protégés, recommending them for promotions, recognitions, and important assignments. Offer Guidance: Provide constructive feedback and advice to help them navigate their career paths and professional challenges. Support Their Visibility: Ensure that the achievements and potential of those you sponsor are visible to senior leadership. Differences Though both delegation and sponsorship aim to develop team members and enhance team performance, they differ in several key aspects:\nScope and Focus: Delegation is task-oriented; it\u0026rsquo;s about assigning specific tasks or projects to team members. Sponsorship is relationship-oriented, focusing on the long-term career development of the individual and often involves a personal commitment to their success.\nLevel of Involvement: In delegation, once a task is assigned, the leader typically steps back, providing guidance and support as needed but allowing the team member to take ownership. In sponsorship, the leader is actively involved in advocating for the individual\u0026rsquo;s career advancement, which includes creating opportunities and promoting their achievements within the organization.\nVisibility: Delegation primarily operates within the context of the team or project, with the delegated tasks and outcomes being visible to the immediate team or department. Sponsorship aims to increase the individual\u0026rsquo;s visibility on a broader scale, often involving senior leadership and decision-makers across the organization.\nObjective: The primary objective of delegation is to enhance efficiency and team capability, ensuring that the right tasks are matched with the right skills, and leaders can focus on strategic areas. Sponsorship, however, is primarily focused on advancing the individual\u0026rsquo;s career, helping them to secure promotions, gain new experiences, and enhance their professional network.\nConclusion As a leader in software engineering, balancing delegation and sponsorship is key to developing a high-performing, motivated, and loyal team. Delegation helps in building a self-reliant team capable of handling tasks with minimal supervision, while sponsorship ensures team members have the opportunities and support they need to advance their careers.\nBy mastering these two essential skills, you not only enhance your leadership capabilities but also contribute to creating an empowering and inclusive work environment that values growth, innovation, and diversity. Remember, the success of your team is a reflection of your success as a leader.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/delegating-sponsoring/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMany times as a Software Engineer you might have realized you grown your toolset of skills and feel you deserve a promotion.

These tools will allow you to support and lead your tech team grow with you.\nMentoring and Coaching In this post, I want to talk about the differences and practical approach to mentor and coach. Even though they are similar, they are situational depending not only on the person you are working with but your own experience and needs of the individual. We can define mentoring as the act of sharing your experience and knowledge with someone to create a learning environment. On the other hand, coaching is the act of guiding someone with open question to find the answers to their own questions.\nMy learnings During early times as an engineering manager at Pivotal, I had the opportunity to meet Lara Hogan, author of the book Resilient Management. In this book, she talks about the different tools you have as a leader to help your team grow.\nThis book and her working sessions helped me understand the difference between mentoring and coaching, and the difference between being encouraging and being direct when it comes to the interactions you have with reports about their work. In this post I will focus on the first part, mentoring and coaching.\nWhat is mentorship? The goal of mentorship is to bring a different perspective to the subject of a topic you have experience with. Usually you explain by example what you did in their position and what was the tradeoff you observed and let the subject absorb and assimilate the situation they are in with your story.\nIn order to mentor you need experience in the field of the mentee’s problem. If this is not a possibility, you might need to find someone in the team that could mentor the person.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s coaching? Coaching is when you navigate the subject in their own thoughts and help them ask the right questions so they map the path from the problem to the possible solutions. You create the environment so that the individual can get the right information from their own experience.\nThis is why if you are an expert of the domain you might lean the questions to your past experiences and deviate from the individual experience and thoughts. It is easier to coach when you do not know the domain of the person you are coaching.\nWhat to keep in mind while mentoring and coaching When mentoring and coaching, it is important to keep in mind the following key points:\nFeedback. Providing feedback is an important part of coaching and mentoring. You should provide constructive feedback that helps the individual improve and grow.\nEmpathy. It is important to be empathetic when coaching or mentoring someone. You need to understand their perspective and be supportive of their goals and aspirations.\nGoal Setting. Coaching and Mentoring are about helping the individual set and achieve their goals. You should help them identify their goals and come up with a plan to achieve them.\nAccountability. You should hold the individual accountable for their actions and help them stay on track with their goals.\nTrust. Building trust is crucial when coaching or mentoring someone. You need to create a safe and supportive environment where the individual feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and experiences.\nCoaching Key Points When coaching someone, particularly in a professional setting, there are several key points to pay attention to ensure the process is effective and beneficial for the individual being coached. Here are some crucial aspects to consider:\nActive Listening. This is the most important aspect of coaching. You need to listen to the person you are coaching and understand their perspective. This will help you ask the right questions and guide them in the right direction.\nOpen-Ended Questions. When coaching, you should ask open-ended questions that encourage the individual to think and reflect on their experiences. This will help them come up with their own solutions and ideas.\nMentoring Key Points Mentoring is different from coaching in that it is more about sharing your experiences and knowledge with the individual. Here are some key points to consider when mentoring someone:\nSharing Experiences. Mentoring is about sharing your experiences and knowledge with the individual. You should provide guidance and advice based on your own experiences.\nRole Modeling. As a mentor, you should be a role model for the individual. You should demonstrate the behaviors and skills that you want the individual to develop.\nSupport. Mentoring is about providing support and guidance to the individual. You should be there to help them navigate their challenges and achieve their goals.\nA Practical approach | The Framework Like most problems of two variables, we can create a 2x2 table to help us understand when to use mentoring and coaching.\nYou know the domain You don\u0026rsquo;t know the domain The individual knows the domain Mentor/Coach Coach The individual doesn\u0026rsquo;t know the domain Mentor Coach You don\u0026rsquo;t know the domain and the individual knows the domain The advice is to coach. This might the best situation for bias since you are not an expert in the domain they need help with.\nEven if the coachee is more knowledgeable in a certain area, a coach can still facilitate growth and development by asking powerful questions, providing feedback, and helping the coachee explore new perspectives and solutions.\nYou know the domain and the individual doesn\u0026rsquo;t know the domain The advice is to mentor. You can share your experiences and knowledge with the individual to help them grow and develop in the domain they are not familiar with.\nYou can provide specific guidance, share knowledge, and offer advice based on their expertise, which is particularly beneficial for someone less experienced in the domain.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t know the domain and the individual doesn\u0026rsquo;t know the domain The advice is to coach.\nWhen both parties are less experienced in a specific domain, you can still effectively support the individual\u0026rsquo;s development through goal setting, accountability, and facilitating self-discovery, rather than direct knowledge transfer.\nYou know the domain and the individual knows the domain In this scenario you are advice to utilize advanced mentoring or coaching and peer mentoring.\nIn scenarios where both parties are highly experienced, the relationship can focus on advanced or niche topics by coaching or mentoring the details, with the possibility of mutual learning (peer mentoring).\nConclusion Mentoring and coaching are both important tools for helping individuals grow and develop. They are similar in many ways, but they are also different and should be used in different situations. By understanding the differences between mentoring and coaching, and when to use each, you can effectively support the growth and development of the individuals you work with.\nIn the next post, I will be talking about the importance of Delegating and Sponsoring in the growth of your team.\nReferences Resilient Management by Lara Hogan.

Some view it as a hindrance, others as the solution. And, like every extreme opinion about any topic, it is wrong to think in absolutes, we are not Sith.\nMy journey with TDD began with Kent Beck\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026ldquo;Test Driven Development by Example,\u0026rdquo; during my Ruby on Rails learning phase. Here, I share my insights, hoping to demystify TDD and its practicality in software development.\nCommon Misconceptions about TDD I have made a lot of mistakes while learning TDD, and like others, I have had misconceptions about it like:\nTest Coverage and the overuse of Unit Tests TDD is not about achieving 100% test coverage or exhausting yourself with unit tests. It\u0026rsquo;s about driving the key aspects like public contracts and business logic, primarily in the Service and API layers, with tests. Overemphasis on test coverage as a code health metric is misleading. Instead, focus on code behavior.\nYou should test what users care about not how the code is written.\nOver-Isolation in Testing Test isolation is crucial, but it\u0026rsquo;s about ensuring tests don\u0026rsquo;t interfere with each other, not excessively mocking dependencies. Over-mocking can lead to missed dependency updates.\nTDD and Clarity of Purpose TDD is most effective when you have a clear understanding of what you\u0026rsquo;re developing. If the project\u0026rsquo;s direction is unclear, it\u0026rsquo;s better to return to the planning stage rather than jump straight into coding. Testing a tool that helps you write better code, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a substitute for good design.\nTesting for User-Centric Behavior Focus your tests on what matters to users, not on the intricacies of code implementation. TDD helps in validating the correctness and behavior of applications, offering rapid and reliable feedback throughout the software lifecycle.\nTesting and Non-functional requirements When refactoring or dealing with performance and implementation changes, breaking tests can indicate either a shift in logic or a flaw in the test itself. Effective Refactoring should guide you to improve code without altering its behavior, and effective TDD focus on aligning with user needs rather than implementation specifics.\nTDD in System Design TDD is closely linked with system design more than the implmentation details of your application. It\u0026rsquo;s a cycle of understanding new requirements, designing solutions, writing tests to validate these designs, and then coding to fulfill them. TDD is not just about writing software; it\u0026rsquo;s about ensuring that software aligns with user needs and system requirements.\nThe Future of TDD For me, this is one of the areas where Artificial Inteligence can help developers build better software as a testing companion for each project. AI can significantly enhance TDD by automating the generation of test cases. Machine learning algorithms can analyze code and generate tests that cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases that developers might not anticipate. This automation can lead to more thorough and efficient testing processes.\nTest Driven Development is not a panacea, nor is it a stumbling block. It\u0026rsquo;s a tool for creating reliable, user-focused software. It prompts us to test behaviors that matter and avoid getting bogged down in implementation details. Embracing TDD means embracing a mindset of continuous improvement and clear focus on what truly benefits the end-user.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/test-drive-development/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn the realm of software development, Test-Driven Development (TDD) often elicits a spectrum of opinions.

People often joke about it and often have nothing interesting to say. More often than not, individuals use this opportunity to brag or express how much effort they are willing to put in to go the extra mile.\nPeople struggle to provide good answers to this question because they don’t often take the time to sit and think about their weaknesses. Growing involves being aware of these weaknesses, which is part of the path to becoming a better person.\nI ask this question during interview to understand if people are aware of the challenging aspects of working with them and, more importantly, if they are actively working to improve those situations. However, let me share mine.\nWhen I feel frustrated, my lack of trust and patience becomes evident in my work relationships, sometimes to the extent that it can affect the teams I work with and my leadership. In extreme cases, this frustration manifests as cynical behavior, typically directed at leadership after prolonged frustration from stagnation. I often mask it with dark humor, but I find relief through meditation and running to clear my mind of these thoughts. I encourage those working with me to call me out if they notice such behavior.\nInitially, these raw comments might seem brave, bold, or even revealing of some truth. However, they are often negative and lack actionable steps to steer things in the right direction, merely reflecting my frustration. Over time, this repetitive behavior drains people\u0026rsquo;s energy and leads them to view me as irritating and uncooperative.\nThe most troubling aspect of this weakness, and the reason I\u0026rsquo;m actively working on it, is that it contradicts who I aspire to be. My goal is to be a kind and empathetic leader, yet these frustrations lead to behaviors that directly oppose this goal. They put me in a position where my relationships are laden with negative thoughts, not only impacting how others perceive me but also harming the teams I work with and becoming the subjects of my thoughts.\nI\u0026rsquo;m working hard to ensure this doesn\u0026rsquo;t become a defining part of my identity, or at least not for prolonged periods. I acknowledge that some aspects of life or work are beyond my control, and frustration is inevitable. Nevertheless, I am committed to maintaining kindness and empathy even during these challenging times.\nUltimately, it\u0026rsquo;s acceptable to have weaknesses and actively work on improving them. If you believe you have none, it\u0026rsquo;s likely because you haven\u0026rsquo;t deeply reflected on it. None of us are perfect. By acknowledging weaknesses, we can minimize their impact. In the next interview, offering a concrete example of your weaknesses can provide the interviewer a glimpse into your growth journey toward becoming a better person.\nThe next time you have a moment for introspection, ask yourself about the most challenging aspect of working with you and what steps you can take to improve it.

These tools will allow you to support and lead your tech team grow with you.\nTeam Cohesion In my first post, I will be talking about Team Cohesion especially working on agile development. Teamwork plays a crucial role in agile, an approach to software development that emphasizes continuous delivery, iterative development, and the ability to quickly respond to change.\nIn an agile team, everyone works together closely to create high-quality software products. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, teamwork and collaboration are one of the top skills that employers look for in job candidates. Therefore, to achieve success as a Software Engineer, you need to work well with others.\nFor everyone working together, team members need to click like pieces of a clock to move the arms in sync. But we are all different. We have different backgrounds, different personalities, and different ways of working. But, we need to find a way to coordinate our efforts in a direction that works for everyone despite our different strengths and weaknesses including unique ways of communicating, learning, and growing.\nWhat can the team do? There are times when team members might not be able to work together as a team. This is where the role of an Engineering Manager comes in. The Engineering Manager is responsible for ensuring that the team is working together effectively and efficiently. One of the most important skills that an Engineering Manager needs to have is to build team cohesion. Team cohesion is the degree to which team members are attracted to, motivated by, and committed to the team. It is the glue that holds the team together, and the reason why people stay in a team and work together to achieve a common goal. Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about some of the tools that could help you build team cohesion.\nTeam user manual One of the tools that an Engineering Manager can use to build team cohesion is the team user manual. The team user manual is a document that describes the team\u0026rsquo;s culture, values, and processes. It is a living document that is constantly updated and improved, and It is shared with all team members and stakeholders. It is a document that is used to onboard new team members and to help them understand the team\u0026rsquo;s culture and processes.\nThe process of building one requires the inclusion of all team members, and how do we achieve it? We need to start by asking all team members to write their user manuals. The manual describes the team member\u0026rsquo;s preferred way of working, communicating, learning, and growing. If you want to see an example of one, here is mine.\nOnce all team members have written their user manuals, the Engineering Manager needs to review them and consolidate them into one document. The document should be shared with all team members and stakeholders. It is important to note that the team user manual is not a static document. It is a living document that is constantly updated and improved.\nWe can describe the team user manual as the common set of rules that the team members follow to work together effectively and efficiently without stepping on each other\u0026rsquo;s toes or forcing others to change their ways of working. It deletes bias from leadership and includes everyone in the process of building the team.\nTeam Charter Another tool that an Engineering Manager can use to build team cohesion is the team charter. The team charter is a document that describes the team\u0026rsquo;s mission, vision, and values. It is another living document that is constantly updated and improved, and It is shared with all team members and stakeholders. The team charter is built with the input of the 3 main users of a team: the team members, the stakeholders, and the customers.\nThe sections of this document include the purpose of the team, the team\u0026rsquo;s mission statement, the team\u0026rsquo;s values, and the engineering principles to follow in the software engineering process. It should describe who are the customers and the market research done to understand their needs. You can also include the structure of the team and relevant information like the team user manual.\nFinally, it roadmaps the strategy and the actions the team will take in the next 3 to 6 months to solve these needs. One of the most efficient ways to drive this effort is with the Object Key Results methodology.\nThis document is a living document that is constantly updated and improved when any of its parts pivots or there are new learnings from the customers. It is a document that is used to onboard new team members and to help them understand the team\u0026rsquo;s mission, vision, and values. It is also used to communicate with stakeholders and customers about the team\u0026rsquo;s strategy and the actions the team will take. The Team Charter connects the stakeholders, the customers, and the team members on a common goal.\nTeam Roadmap Now that we know the rules of the team and the team\u0026rsquo;s purpose, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the product that they build. To build cohesion in the team, the team members need to know what they are working on and what they are planning to do next. We split this into blocks of work called sprints.\nThis is where the team roadmap comes in. The team roadmap is a document that describes the team\u0026rsquo;s product strategy and the actions the team will take in the next release to improve the product they are working on.\nWith the roadmap, we can estimate the amount of work the team will be able to deliver for each sprint. We can also estimate the amount of time it will take to deliver the features. It also helps the stakeholders to understand the team\u0026rsquo;s progress and to know what they can expect from the team in the next release.\nAt any given moment every team member can read the roadmap and understand the priorities the team has and what is the next most valuable thing to work on. The roadmap also helps the leadership of the team surface any blockers or risks that might prevent the team from delivering the features on time. It also helps them set confidence levels for the team\u0026rsquo;s progress.\nEffective Communication Something worst than not collaborating is collaborating poorly. Effective communication is the key to building team cohesion. It is the key to building trust and making sure that everyone is on the same page, and making sure that everyone is working on the most valuable thing to work on.\nWe need to communicate in a way that is clear, concise, and actionable.\nSet clear expectations: Ensure that everyone on the team understands their roles and responsibilities and the expected outcomes. This helps to avoid misunderstandings and ensures that everyone is working towards the same goals.\nFoster an open-door policy: Encourage team members to approach each other with any questions or concerns they may have. Creating a safe environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas is crucial for effective collaboration.\nUse the right communication channels: Different situations call for different communication channels. For example, instant messaging may be more appropriate for quick questions or asynchronous updates, while synchronous meetings may be better for more detailed information and discussions. Utilizing the appropriate communication channels can help to ensure that messages are delivered and received promptly.\nPractice active listening: Communication is a two-way street, and effective listening is just as important as effective speaking. Encourage team members to actively listen to each other, ask clarifying questions, and provide feedback.\nProvide regular updates: Regular check-ins can help to keep everyone informed of the team\u0026rsquo;s progress and any changes in direction. This helps to avoid surprises and allows team members to adjust their work accordingly.\nConclusion In this post, we talked about the importance of team cohesion in agile development. We also talked about the tools that you can use to build team cohesion and grow the team around you. To collaborate effectively we need to understand who we are, how we want to work, what are the most valuable objectives to work on, and how are we going to communicate to update each other. In my next post, I will be talking about Coaching and Mentoring and how to do it effectively. I will also be talking about the different types of coaching and mentoring and how to choose the right one for your team.\nReferences The Agile Manifesto Developing and Sustaining High-Performance Work Teams The 5 Dysfunctions of a Team ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/teamwork-collaboration/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMany times as a Software Engineer you might have realized you grown your toolset of skills and feel you deserve a promotion.

We want to deliver value to our customers, but we also need to maintain the health of our systems and the wellbeing of our teams. It\u0026rsquo;s a delicate balancing act, and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to feel like we\u0026rsquo;re always falling short in one area or another. I decided to break down patterns I\u0026rsquo;ve encountered over the years building teams, and I\u0026rsquo;ve realized that there are two distinct modes that teams operate in: Delivery Mode and Rescue Mode.\nThe idea of spliting the team modes into two came from reading the book The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz. In the book, Horowitz talks about the difference between running a company during good times and running a company during bad times. He argues that management techniques must flip entirely depending on the context.\nPeacetime CEO: Focuses on culture, fostering creativity, and minimizing conflict. They have the luxury of time to build consensus. Wartime CEO: Focuses on the prime directive (market survival). They care little about feelings or consensus; they care about the strict adherence to the path that leads to safety. An engineering manager must similarly toggle their style, being an empathetic coach in Peace (Delivery Mode) and a directive commander in War (Rescue Mode).\nTrying to apply the same tools, processes, and leadership style to every situation leads to frustration: sprint planning feels bureaucratic during a production outage, and incident style urgency burns people out when applied to routine feature work. The reality is that each mode demands a different point of view and a different set of levers.\nBy explicitly naming Delivery Mode and Rescue Mode, you gain clarity:\nRight tool for the job: Instead of forcing one process to cover all scenarios, you can adopt tools and rituals purpose built for each context. OKRs and sprint planning for Delivery, incident command and war rooms for Rescue. Faster mode recognition: Once you learn to identify which mode you\u0026rsquo;re in, you stop wasting time applying the wrong playbook. The question shifts from \u0026ldquo;why isn\u0026rsquo;t this working?\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;which mode are we in, and what does that mode require?\u0026rdquo; Reduced cognitive load: Your team can relax into the current mode\u0026rsquo;s expectations instead of constantly renegotiating how to work. The goal isn\u0026rsquo;t to eliminate Rescue Mode since some level of crisis is inevitable. The goal is to know which mode you\u0026rsquo;re in, apply the right approach, and transition cleanly when circumstances change. This document is designed to help you do exactly that.\nIn the sections that follow, we\u0026rsquo;ll define each mode in detail, what triggers it, what success looks like, and what leadership behaviors it demands. We\u0026rsquo;ll also explore the \u0026ldquo;burst capacity\u0026rdquo; model (how much Rescue Mode a team can absorb before burning out), dependency management (why other teams\u0026rsquo; crises become yours), and practical checklists for transitioning between modes. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re currently firefighting or enjoying a calm sprint, this framework will give you a shared vocabulary and a playbook for both.\nCore Concepts Delivery Mode: Sustainable Growth The default state. Validating the path, optimizing the machine, and growing the team.\nIn Delivery Mode, the backlog is clear, and the environment is predictable. Leadership focuses on long-term sustainability, career growth, and system hygiene.\nAspect Description Primary Objective Deliver roadmap value sustainably Mindset Thoughtful, predictable, optimize for long-term throughput Operating Constraints Keep work predictable; protect focus time Typical Signals Stable on-call, known backlog, low \u0026ldquo;unknown unknowns\u0026rdquo; Success Metrics Velocity, capacity, quality, predictability Key Activities:\nDelivery \u0026amp; Planning: Sprint execution, OKRs, capacity/velocity management People \u0026amp; Org: Onboarding, coaching/mentoring, performance cycles, hiring Technical Excellence: System design reviews, refactoring, dev lifecycle improvements, TDD Learning \u0026amp; Leverage: Stretch goals, deliberate learning, platform investments that compound Artifacts: Plans/OKRs, design reviews, career plans, tech debt strategy, hiring plan Rescue Mode: Crisis Response The exception state. High operational intensity, unknown territories, and immediate survival.\nIn Rescue Mode, the team faces perceived chaos due toincidents, security threats, or existential business deadlines. The path is unclear or obstructed, and the standard process is often too slow.\nAspect Description Primary Objective Restore service/safety fast, reduce blast radius, return to Delivery Mode Mindset Alert, decisive, action-oriented Operating Constraints Context switching is expensive; comms must be tight Typical Signals Sev-0/1, active exploit/CVE, outage, major regression, urgent escalations Success Metrics MTTD, MTTR, customer impact containment Key Activities:\nReliability Incidents: Sev-0/1 response, on-call escalations, detection + recovery Security Response: CVEs, active threats, emergency patching/mitigations Operational Interrupts: Urgent support escalations, after-hours stabilization Business-Critical Crunch: \u0026ldquo;Do-or-die\u0026rdquo; moments, funding deadlines, existential customer impact Artifacts: Incident timeline, decision log, status updates, postmortem + follow-ups The Burst Capacity Model Every team has a burst capacity for Rescue Mode similar to AWS EBS burst credits.\nKey Principles Finite Resource: Teams cannot sustain Rescue Mode indefinitely without burning out Recovery Time Required: After Rescue Mode, teams need Delivery time to recover and recharge Predictability Trade-off: Too much Rescue Mode erodes stability, morale, and predictability Cannot Be Cut: Rescue Mode work takes as long as it takes—you cannot artificially constrain it Warning Signs of Burnout Decreased velocity in Delivery Mode Increased employee turnover Declining code quality Reduced engagement in planning activities More incidents (creating a negative feedback loop) Critical Success Factors For Rescue Mode Success Factor Description Trust Team members must trust each other\u0026rsquo;s technical judgment under pressure Tooling Automated detection, deployment, rollback, and monitoring reduce MTTR Onboarding Every team member must be fully onboarded to contribute during crises Focus Eliminate all distractions outside the critical task Clear Communication Defined incident commander roles and communication protocols DORA Metrics for Rescue Mode:\nMTTR (Mean Time to Recovery): How quickly can you restore service? MTTD (Mean Time to Detection): How quickly do you identify issues? For Delivery Mode Success Factor Description Rhythm and Ritual Establish sustainable work patterns and ceremonies Automation Automate toil work to maximize time for business value Capacity Planning Realistic estimation accounting for potential Rescue Mode interruptions Career Investment Dedicate time to mentoring, feedback, and development Technical Excellence Pay down debt proactively to prevent future incidents Dependency Management and System Resilience Critical Principle: A system is only as strong as its weakest link (internal or external).\nThe Dependency Problem Your team\u0026rsquo;s Rescue Mode frequency is affected by:\nNumber of dependencies on external services Hardness of coupling (hard vs. soft dependencies) Resilience patterns implemented (circuit breakers, timeouts, graceful degradation) Example Scenario Your service displays customer data including \u0026ldquo;last 3 orders\u0026rdquo; from an external Orders service:\nDependency Type Behavior Your Mode Hard Dependency Orders service down → Your service appears down Enter Rescue Mode Soft Dependency Orders service down → Your service shows data without orders Remain in Delivery Mode Mitigation Strategies Make non-critical attributes optional Implement circuit breakers and fallbacks Cache data for resilience Design for graceful degradation Establish clear SLA expectations with dependency owners Incident Command Structure Use an incident command structure so the team can execute without everyone trying to lead at once:\nRole Responsibility Incident Commander (IC) Owns decisions + keeps the incident moving Comms Lead Stakeholder/customer updates, keeps noise off responders Ops/Tech Lead(s) Directs technical investigation and mitigations Scribe Timeline + decisions + actions captured live Exit Criteria (\u0026ldquo;Back to Delivery\u0026rdquo; Checklist) Customer impact stopped or bounded Monitoring confirms stability trend Short-term mitigation in place (even if root cause isn\u0026rsquo;t fully fixed) Postmortem scheduled and owners assigned Leadership Responsibilities by Mode Delivery Mode Leadership ✓ Focus on career development and growth opportunities ✓ Maintain predictable velocity and capacity planning ✓ Work on team alignment and priority setting ✓ Invest in automation and toil reduction ✓ Build resilience through architecture and tooling ✓ Create psychological safety and trust ✓ Hire and onboard effectively ✓ Review and optimize processes Rescue Mode Leadership ✓ Define clear success criteria for resolution ✓ Identify steps to return to Delivery Mode ✓ Remove obstacles and distractions ✓ Communicate status to stakeholders ✓ Ensure proper incident command structure ✓ Monitor team energy and prevent burnout ✓ Document decisions for AAR ✓ Shield team from external pressure Post Rescue Mode Leadership ✓ Conduct After-Action Reviews (AAR) and postmortems ✓ Identify root causes and prevention measures ✓ Update runbooks and tooling ✓ Give team recovery time ✓ Recognize contributions and effort ✓ Implement improvements to reduce future occurrence Communicating Mode Transitions Clear communication during mode transitions prevents confusion and sets expectations. Ambiguity about \u0026ldquo;are we in incident mode or not?\u0026rdquo; leads to half-measures and delayed responses.\nEntering Rescue Mode (Delivery → Rescue) To the Team:\nExplicit declaration: \u0026ldquo;We are now in Rescue Mode. [Brief description of the trigger].\u0026rdquo; Assign roles immediately: \u0026ldquo;IC is [name], Comms is [name].\u0026rdquo; State the success criteria: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re done when [X metric is restored / customer impact is stopped].\u0026rdquo; Clear expectation shift: \u0026ldquo;All sprint work is paused. Focus only on this.\u0026rdquo; To Stakeholders:\nUse a standing incident communication template:\n\u0026ldquo;We have identified [issue]. Impact: [scope]. Current status: [investigating/mitigating]. Next update in [30 min].\u0026rdquo; Over-communicate cadence, under-communicate speculation. Exiting Rescue Mode (Rescue → Delivery) To the Team:\nExplicit stand-down: \u0026ldquo;We are exiting Rescue Mode. The immediate threat is contained.\u0026rdquo; Acknowledge the work: Quick recognition of effort before moving on. Set recovery expectations: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re resuming sprint work tomorrow. Today is buffer/decompression.\u0026rdquo; Schedule the postmortem: \u0026ldquo;Postmortem is [date]. Action items will flow into the backlog.\u0026rdquo; To Stakeholders:\nFinal incident summary:\n\u0026ldquo;Issue resolved at [time]. Root cause: [brief]. Customer impact: [duration/scope]. Follow-up postmortem scheduled.\u0026rdquo; Rituals That Reinforce Mode Awareness Ritual Purpose Status channel A single #team-status channel where mode is always visible (\u0026quot;🟢 Delivery\u0026quot; or \u0026ldquo;🔴 Rescue: [incident link]\u0026rdquo;) Standup framing Start every standup with \u0026ldquo;We are in [Mode].\u0026rdquo; Reinforces shared awareness. Calendar block When entering Rescue Mode, IC or manager cancels/postpones non-essential meetings for the team. Post Incident Follow Through A postmortem without owners and dates becomes a diary. The value of Rescue Mode isn\u0026rsquo;t just surviving the incident—it\u0026rsquo;s learning from it so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen again.\nThe Postmortem Checklist Every postmortem should produce:\nOutput Description Timeline What happened, when, and who did what. Facts only, no blame. Root Cause(s) The underlying issue(s), not just the trigger. Use \u0026ldquo;5 Whys\u0026rdquo; or similar. Contributing Factors What made detection slower or impact larger? Action Items Concrete tasks with owners and due dates. What Went Well Reinforce behaviors you want repeated. Tying Actions to the Backlog Postmortem action items must flow into your tracked work system (Jira, Linear, etc.):\nCreate tickets immediately — Don\u0026rsquo;t wait. Do it in the postmortem meeting. Tag them consistently — Use a label like postmortem or incident follow up for visibility. Assign owners, not teams — \u0026ldquo;Team X will fix this\u0026rdquo; means no one will fix this. Set realistic due dates — Balance urgency against current Delivery Mode capacity. Review in sprint planning — Postmortem items compete for capacity like any other work. Follow Through Rituals Ritual Purpose Postmortem review meeting 48-72 hours after incident. Fresh enough to remember, calm enough to think. Action item standup tag Weekly check: \u0026ldquo;Any postmortem items blocked or at risk?\u0026rdquo; Monthly incident review Leadership reviews open postmortem actions. Escalates stale items. Quarterly retro Are we seeing repeat patterns? Is our prevention investment working? Anti-Patterns to Avoid ❌ Postmortem delayed indefinitely — Schedule it before closing the incident. ❌ Actions without owners — If no one owns it, it won\u0026rsquo;t happen. ❌ \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll be more careful\u0026rdquo; — Not an action. What system change prevents recurrence? ❌ 100-item action list — Pick the 3-5 highest-leverage items. The rest goes to tech debt backlog. ❌ Blame culture — If people fear punishment, they\u0026rsquo;ll hide information. You\u0026rsquo;ll learn nothing. Team Maturity Assessment How do you know if your team is actually good at operating in both modes? Maturity isn\u0026rsquo;t about never entering Rescue Mode but how smoothly you operate in each mode and how gracefully you transition between them.\nUse this framework to assess where your team stands and where to invest.\nRescue Mode Effectiveness A mature team in Rescue Mode doesn\u0026rsquo;t panic. They\u0026rsquo;ve built the muscle memory and tooling to respond quickly without chaos. Assess your team on:\nDimension What to Look For Speed of detection and response How long between \u0026ldquo;something is wrong\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re actively working on it\u0026rdquo;? MTTD and MTTR are your primary signals. Quality of communication Are stakeholders informed without responders being interrupted? Is there a single source of truth? Ability to execute under pressure Does the team fragment or unite? Do people know their roles, or is there confusion about who decides what? Post-incident learning Do postmortems happen? Do actions get completed? Are you seeing fewer repeat incidents over time? Red flags: Finger-pointing during incidents, no clear IC, stakeholders pinging individual engineers for status, repeat incidents on the same root cause.\nDelivery Mode Effectiveness A mature team in Delivery Mode operates predictably and sustainably. They\u0026rsquo;re not just shipping—they\u0026rsquo;re building capability for the future. Assess your team on:\nDimension What to Look For Consistent velocity and predictability Can you forecast what will ship this sprint with reasonable accuracy? Or is every sprint a surprise? Proactive debt management Is tech debt addressed intentionally, or only when it causes outages? Do you have a debt backlog? Career development culture Are 1:1s happening? Are people growing? Do ICs have visibility into their path forward? Low unplanned work percentage What fraction of your sprint is reactive vs. planned? High unplanned work erodes trust and predictability. Red flags: \u0026ldquo;We never have time for refactoring,\u0026rdquo; cancelled 1:1s, engineers surprised by their performance reviews, constant scope creep.\nWhat Mature Teams Look Like Rescue Mode is a calm workflow, not a panic. Roles are clear, runbooks exist, and people trust each other. Most time is spent in Delivery Mode. Rescue Mode is the exception, not the norm. Rescue Mode frequency is decreasing over time. Prevention investments are paying off. DORA metrics trend positively. Deployment frequency up, lead time down, change failure rate down, MTTR down. The team can articulate which mode they\u0026rsquo;re in. Shared vocabulary exists and is used. Common Pitfalls and Anti-Patterns ❌ Attempting to Budget Rescue Mode Work \u0026ldquo;Ops days\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;on-call effort\u0026rdquo; percentages are estimates at best Rescue Mode work cannot be cut due to time constraints Attempting to time-box critical incidents leads to poor outcomes ❌ Treating All Work as Delivery Mode Applying standard planning processes during crises creates delays Requiring extensive documentation before action during incidents Not recognizing when to shift gears ❌ Operating in Permanent Rescue Mode Treating every task as urgent undermines true priorities Team burnout and turnover No time for strategic improvements Accumulating technical debt ❌ Ignoring Post-Rescue Recovery Immediately returning to normal sprint work without reflection No AAR or postmortem process Missing opportunities for prevention Team exhaustion accumulates Final Tips Engineering leadership requires fluency in both Delivery and Rescue modes. Success comes from:\nBuilding trust and capability during Delivery Mode to enable effective Rescue Mode response Investing in tooling and automation to reduce toil and improve MTTR/MTTD Managing dependencies to prevent cascading failures Creating sustainable rhythms that allow for recovery and growth Learning continuously from incidents to prevent recurrence The most mature teams minimize time in Rescue Mode through prevention while maintaining the capability to execute effectively when crises occur. Your role as a leader is to create the conditions for both modes to succeed without burning out your team.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/team-modes/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAs engineering leaders, we are constantly juggling competing priorities.

The conversation around Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) seems to be very binary, either \u0026ldquo;force people to hire diversity no matter the cost\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;just hire the most qualified person.\u0026rdquo; In a domain where it is never black and white, this polarized approach feels wrong. Like every polarized conversation, it divides people, causing them to defend their positions and attack those who think differently. DEI plays a role in a very grey and biased ecosystem, which is hiring, and you cannot have polarized policies or opinions when it comes to who you are working with.\nDEI comes from the idea that a diverse group of experiences can yield better results when your job is to solve problems that affect all of us. My organization embedded it throughout the entire employee lifecycle—from hiring to promotion and raises. We trained ourselves to remove as much bias as we could to make the best decisions based on merit and skill. In software development, this strategy can be seen in how we consider disabilities, symbolism, and the organization of different points of view.\nI want to share my perspective, shaped by my own experience working within an organization that successfully embraced a thoughtful DEI framework. This is a delicate topic, but it’s one that benefits immensely from kindness and empathy.\nEliminating Bias, Not Lowering the Bar In my opinion, the true power of effective DEI programs is not to \u0026ldquo;quota\u0026rdquo; the teams you build, but to relentlessly expose and eliminate bias in the hiring teams themselves. DEI reduces bias by helping hiring teams pay attention to what really matters, not what feels more comfortable.\nWe cannot deny that it\u0026rsquo;s human nature to feel safer in spaces where there are people like us. When tasked with choosing a new colleague, the unconscious default is often to select someone who mirrors our own characteristics, especially if we fail to examine our own judgment biases.\nThe phrase \u0026ldquo;just hire the most qualified person\u0026rdquo; reveals to me a fundamental misunderstanding of the hiring process. Hiring is a very vague journey where the goal is to find a qualified person who can successfully do the job in a reasonable time, not magically identify the single \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; employee, particularly when the decision is filtered through a few hours of conversation with a handful of biased teammates.\nThis vague hiring process is where DEI plays a crucial role to eliminate biases as much as we can so that any candidate with the right skills is not disadvantaged by characteristics that might make them less appealing to the hiring team\u0026rsquo;s unconscious preferences. Since minorities are more likely to encounter this bias as problematic, DEI addresses this by reducing bias during the process.\nThe Business of Hiring: Acknowledging the Grey The hiring ecosystem is a mix of grey. The bright line that should never be crossed is where we lower the bar for hiring because we are not getting enough diversity in our interviewee groups. Hiring is also a business decision that should take into consideration skills and merit. I am sure people want to be hired based on their merit, not their identity—which has not changed since they were born.\nIf your hiring process is successful, you\u0026rsquo;ll often get multiple people who are qualified for the job. In this case, choosing randomly would yield a similar outcome to spending a lot more effort trying to determine who is marginally more qualified. This is also an opportunity to organize the team with the new hire in mind, introducing a member who will not only bring the required skills but also bridge experience gaps that exist in the team.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s be honest—a normal hiring process looks more like the secretary problem than choosing the local maximum.\nThe Representation Question Most people would agree that when we talk about fighting for more representation, we\u0026rsquo;re not talking about entry-level jobs but those roles that can really steer the ship of an organization. For the past few decades in tech, we have seen many of these positions filled by a specific group of people, leaving us with the question: \u0026ldquo;Is there a more diverse way to lead?\u0026rdquo;\nTo answer this, we need to dive deeper into the representation of individuals who studied tech 30 years ago, which was not very diverse. That distribution is compounded by the level of stress and endurance someone needs to have to rise to that level of leadership. These positions are not something I would be able to take on. In my opinion, these positions are too much for one person, but there are people willing to take them on and absorb the responsibilities that entail.\nI am hopeful that more diverse groups are coming out of universities and entering the job market, and we will see in 30 years a more diverse group of C-level executives and directors than we see today, improving the representation people are hoping for.\nMoving Forward with Kindness The need for robust DEI programs was created by decades of systemic and cultural trends in the workforce. We need to focus on understanding what happened and what is currently happening, rather than resorting to blame and pointing fingers.\nWe are a group of individuals with complex lives trying to find a space to explore our skills alongside other people who have their own complex lives. We can choose to be kind to each other. In my personal experience, more diverse teams tend to be more kind and understanding with others than teams where everyone shares the same background.\nDEI\u0026rsquo;s strength is not about forcing anyone to fill a quota of diversity. It\u0026rsquo;s about recognizing our human tendency to gravitate toward similarity and providing tools to ensure we\u0026rsquo;re making decisions based on skills, merit, and potential rather than unconscious comfort with familiarity.\nLet us commit to kindness, empathy, and the continuous, difficult work of reducing bias. When we do this, we don\u0026rsquo;t compromise merit. We clarify it, ensuring that true skill is what ultimately prevails.\nAlways be kind.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/dei-use-case/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI know this is a delicate topic to talk about, but I wanted to share my personal experience and opinion.

This statement might have puzzled you, since when has your performance as an individual contributor had anything to do with other people? It is called the Individual Contributor path for a reason, no?\nWhile you may excel in your technical skills and abilities, it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember that most software engineering positions involve working with a team. Collaboration between developers, product managers, and designers can lead to better products and make you a valuable member of the team.\nTeamwork Series We can define Software Engineering as the union of people, processes, and products to enable the continuous delivery of value to our end users. There can be no promotion if the team does not grow with it.\n\u0026ldquo;Teamwork\u0026rdquo; is a series of posts where I will be sharing my learnings from topics surrounding working with teams like Team Cohesion, Coaching and Mentoring, Delegating and Sponsoring, and others from the perspective of an Engineering Manager. These tools will allow you to support and lead your tech team grow with you.\nDelegating and Sponsoring In the dynamic world of software engineering, effective leadership transcends beyond just managing tasks and projects. It involves mastering the arts of delegation and sponsorship \u0026ndash; two pivotal skills that can significantly enhance team performance, foster professional growth, and drive innovation.\nUnderstanding when and how to delegate tasks, as well as how to sponsor and advocate for your team members, can set you apart as a leader in the tech industry. Delegation and sponsorship share some similarities in their focus on developing team members and enhancing team performance, but they also have distinct differences in their approach and objectives.\nDelegating Delegation is more than just assigning tasks; it\u0026rsquo;s entrusting responsibility and authority to team members to complete those tasks. It\u0026rsquo;s a strategic tool that enables leaders to manage their workload more efficiently, while simultaneously empowering team members, enhancing their skills, and fostering a sense of trust and accountability within the team.\nDelegation empowers team members by entrusting them with important tasks, which boosts their confidence and engagement. It allows team members to develop new skills and expertise, preparing them for more significant roles in the future. And by delegating, leaders can distribute workloads more evenly, ensuring that tasks are completed by those with the most appropriate skills and bandwidth.\nDelegate Effectively Effective delegation requires choosing the right tasks to delegate, selecting the appropriate team members based on their skills and development needs, providing clear instructions, and offering support and feedback throughout the process.\nChoose the Right Tasks: Not all tasks are suitable for delegation. Choose tasks that contribute to team members\u0026rsquo; growth and are aligned with their skills and career aspirations. Select the Right People: Consider the skills, interests, and developmental needs of your team members when delegating tasks. Provide Clear Expectations: Clearly communicate the task objectives, deadlines, and any relevant information to ensure understanding and alignment. Empower with Authority: Ensure that team members have the authority and resources they need to complete the task successfully. Monitor Progress and Provide Feedback: Check in periodically to monitor progress, offer guidance, and provide constructive feedback. Sponsorship Sponsorship goes beyond mentorship; it involves actively advocating for and investing in the professional development of team members. A sponsor not only offers guidance and support but also uses their influence to open doors and create opportunities for those they sponsor.\nSponsors use their influence to open doors, provide high-profile opportunities, and ensure that the accomplishments and potential of the individuals they support are recognized at decision-making levels.\nSponsorship can play a critical role in the career advancement of team members by providing them with visibility and opportunities. Feeling supported and having clear career advancement opportunities can significantly improve team member retention. Effective sponsorship can help break down barriers and promote diversity and inclusion within leadership roles.\nSponsor Effectively This role is crucial for career development and often involves a personal commitment to the sponsored individual\u0026rsquo;s success, making it a powerful tool for promoting talent within the organization, especially for underrepresented groups.\nIdentify Talent: Look for team members who show potential, commitment, and a drive to grow within the company. Provide Opportunities: Offer challenging projects, introduce them to key stakeholders, and involve them in high-visibility tasks. Advocate: Use your influence to advocate for your protégés, recommending them for promotions, recognitions, and important assignments. Offer Guidance: Provide constructive feedback and advice to help them navigate their career paths and professional challenges. Support Their Visibility: Ensure that the achievements and potential of those you sponsor are visible to senior leadership. Differences Though both delegation and sponsorship aim to develop team members and enhance team performance, they differ in several key aspects:\nScope and Focus: Delegation is task-oriented; it\u0026rsquo;s about assigning specific tasks or projects to team members. Sponsorship is relationship-oriented, focusing on the long-term career development of the individual and often involves a personal commitment to their success.\nLevel of Involvement: In delegation, once a task is assigned, the leader typically steps back, providing guidance and support as needed but allowing the team member to take ownership. In sponsorship, the leader is actively involved in advocating for the individual\u0026rsquo;s career advancement, which includes creating opportunities and promoting their achievements within the organization.\nVisibility: Delegation primarily operates within the context of the team or project, with the delegated tasks and outcomes being visible to the immediate team or department. Sponsorship aims to increase the individual\u0026rsquo;s visibility on a broader scale, often involving senior leadership and decision-makers across the organization.\nObjective: The primary objective of delegation is to enhance efficiency and team capability, ensuring that the right tasks are matched with the right skills, and leaders can focus on strategic areas. Sponsorship, however, is primarily focused on advancing the individual\u0026rsquo;s career, helping them to secure promotions, gain new experiences, and enhance their professional network.\nConclusion As a leader in software engineering, balancing delegation and sponsorship is key to developing a high-performing, motivated, and loyal team. Delegation helps in building a self-reliant team capable of handling tasks with minimal supervision, while sponsorship ensures team members have the opportunities and support they need to advance their careers.\nBy mastering these two essential skills, you not only enhance your leadership capabilities but also contribute to creating an empowering and inclusive work environment that values growth, innovation, and diversity. Remember, the success of your team is a reflection of your success as a leader.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/delegating-sponsoring/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMany times as a Software Engineer you might have realized you grown your toolset of skills and feel you deserve a promotion.

There can be no promotion if the team does not grow with it.\n\u0026ldquo;Teamwork\u0026rdquo; is a series of posts where I will be sharing my learnings from topics surrounding working with teams like Team Cohesion, Coaching and Mentoring, Delegating and Sponsoring, and others from the perspective of an Engineering Manager. These tools will allow you to support and lead your tech team grow with you.\nMentoring and Coaching In this post, I want to talk about the differences and practical approach to mentor and coach. Even though they are similar, they are situational depending not only on the person you are working with but your own experience and needs of the individual. We can define mentoring as the act of sharing your experience and knowledge with someone to create a learning environment. On the other hand, coaching is the act of guiding someone with open question to find the answers to their own questions.\nMy learnings During early times as an engineering manager at Pivotal, I had the opportunity to meet Lara Hogan, author of the book Resilient Management. In this book, she talks about the different tools you have as a leader to help your team grow.\nThis book and her working sessions helped me understand the difference between mentoring and coaching, and the difference between being encouraging and being direct when it comes to the interactions you have with reports about their work. In this post I will focus on the first part, mentoring and coaching.\nWhat is mentorship? The goal of mentorship is to bring a different perspective to the subject of a topic you have experience with. Usually you explain by example what you did in their position and what was the tradeoff you observed and let the subject absorb and assimilate the situation they are in with your story.\nIn order to mentor you need experience in the field of the mentee’s problem. If this is not a possibility, you might need to find someone in the team that could mentor the person.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s coaching? Coaching is when you navigate the subject in their own thoughts and help them ask the right questions so they map the path from the problem to the possible solutions. You create the environment so that the individual can get the right information from their own experience.\nThis is why if you are an expert of the domain you might lean the questions to your past experiences and deviate from the individual experience and thoughts. It is easier to coach when you do not know the domain of the person you are coaching.\nWhat to keep in mind while mentoring and coaching When mentoring and coaching, it is important to keep in mind the following key points:\nFeedback. Providing feedback is an important part of coaching and mentoring. You should provide constructive feedback that helps the individual improve and grow.\nEmpathy. It is important to be empathetic when coaching or mentoring someone. You need to understand their perspective and be supportive of their goals and aspirations.\nGoal Setting. Coaching and Mentoring are about helping the individual set and achieve their goals. You should help them identify their goals and come up with a plan to achieve them.\nAccountability. You should hold the individual accountable for their actions and help them stay on track with their goals.\nTrust. Building trust is crucial when coaching or mentoring someone. You need to create a safe and supportive environment where the individual feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and experiences.\nCoaching Key Points When coaching someone, particularly in a professional setting, there are several key points to pay attention to ensure the process is effective and beneficial for the individual being coached. Here are some crucial aspects to consider:\nActive Listening. This is the most important aspect of coaching. You need to listen to the person you are coaching and understand their perspective. This will help you ask the right questions and guide them in the right direction.\nOpen-Ended Questions. When coaching, you should ask open-ended questions that encourage the individual to think and reflect on their experiences. This will help them come up with their own solutions and ideas.\nMentoring Key Points Mentoring is different from coaching in that it is more about sharing your experiences and knowledge with the individual. Here are some key points to consider when mentoring someone:\nSharing Experiences. Mentoring is about sharing your experiences and knowledge with the individual. You should provide guidance and advice based on your own experiences.\nRole Modeling. As a mentor, you should be a role model for the individual. You should demonstrate the behaviors and skills that you want the individual to develop.\nSupport. Mentoring is about providing support and guidance to the individual. You should be there to help them navigate their challenges and achieve their goals.\nA Practical approach | The Framework Like most problems of two variables, we can create a 2x2 table to help us understand when to use mentoring and coaching.\nYou know the domain You don\u0026rsquo;t know the domain The individual knows the domain Mentor/Coach Coach The individual doesn\u0026rsquo;t know the domain Mentor Coach You don\u0026rsquo;t know the domain and the individual knows the domain The advice is to coach. This might the best situation for bias since you are not an expert in the domain they need help with.\nEven if the coachee is more knowledgeable in a certain area, a coach can still facilitate growth and development by asking powerful questions, providing feedback, and helping the coachee explore new perspectives and solutions.\nYou know the domain and the individual doesn\u0026rsquo;t know the domain The advice is to mentor. You can share your experiences and knowledge with the individual to help them grow and develop in the domain they are not familiar with.\nYou can provide specific guidance, share knowledge, and offer advice based on their expertise, which is particularly beneficial for someone less experienced in the domain.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t know the domain and the individual doesn\u0026rsquo;t know the domain The advice is to coach.\nWhen both parties are less experienced in a specific domain, you can still effectively support the individual\u0026rsquo;s development through goal setting, accountability, and facilitating self-discovery, rather than direct knowledge transfer.\nYou know the domain and the individual knows the domain In this scenario you are advice to utilize advanced mentoring or coaching and peer mentoring.\nIn scenarios where both parties are highly experienced, the relationship can focus on advanced or niche topics by coaching or mentoring the details, with the possibility of mutual learning (peer mentoring).\nConclusion Mentoring and coaching are both important tools for helping individuals grow and develop. They are similar in many ways, but they are also different and should be used in different situations. By understanding the differences between mentoring and coaching, and when to use each, you can effectively support the growth and development of the individuals you work with.\nIn the next post, I will be talking about the importance of Delegating and Sponsoring in the growth of your team.\nReferences Resilient Management by Lara Hogan.

Some view it as a hindrance, others as the solution. And, like every extreme opinion about any topic, it is wrong to think in absolutes, we are not Sith.\nMy journey with TDD began with Kent Beck\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026ldquo;Test Driven Development by Example,\u0026rdquo; during my Ruby on Rails learning phase. Here, I share my insights, hoping to demystify TDD and its practicality in software development.\nCommon Misconceptions about TDD I have made a lot of mistakes while learning TDD, and like others, I have had misconceptions about it like:\nTest Coverage and the overuse of Unit Tests TDD is not about achieving 100% test coverage or exhausting yourself with unit tests. It\u0026rsquo;s about driving the key aspects like public contracts and business logic, primarily in the Service and API layers, with tests. Overemphasis on test coverage as a code health metric is misleading. Instead, focus on code behavior.\nYou should test what users care about not how the code is written.\nOver-Isolation in Testing Test isolation is crucial, but it\u0026rsquo;s about ensuring tests don\u0026rsquo;t interfere with each other, not excessively mocking dependencies. Over-mocking can lead to missed dependency updates.\nTDD and Clarity of Purpose TDD is most effective when you have a clear understanding of what you\u0026rsquo;re developing. If the project\u0026rsquo;s direction is unclear, it\u0026rsquo;s better to return to the planning stage rather than jump straight into coding. Testing a tool that helps you write better code, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a substitute for good design.\nTesting for User-Centric Behavior Focus your tests on what matters to users, not on the intricacies of code implementation. TDD helps in validating the correctness and behavior of applications, offering rapid and reliable feedback throughout the software lifecycle.\nTesting and Non-functional requirements When refactoring or dealing with performance and implementation changes, breaking tests can indicate either a shift in logic or a flaw in the test itself. Effective Refactoring should guide you to improve code without altering its behavior, and effective TDD focus on aligning with user needs rather than implementation specifics.\nTDD in System Design TDD is closely linked with system design more than the implmentation details of your application. It\u0026rsquo;s a cycle of understanding new requirements, designing solutions, writing tests to validate these designs, and then coding to fulfill them. TDD is not just about writing software; it\u0026rsquo;s about ensuring that software aligns with user needs and system requirements.\nThe Future of TDD For me, this is one of the areas where Artificial Inteligence can help developers build better software as a testing companion for each project. AI can significantly enhance TDD by automating the generation of test cases. Machine learning algorithms can analyze code and generate tests that cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases that developers might not anticipate. This automation can lead to more thorough and efficient testing processes.\nTest Driven Development is not a panacea, nor is it a stumbling block. It\u0026rsquo;s a tool for creating reliable, user-focused software. It prompts us to test behaviors that matter and avoid getting bogged down in implementation details. Embracing TDD means embracing a mindset of continuous improvement and clear focus on what truly benefits the end-user.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/test-drive-development/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn the realm of software development, Test-Driven Development (TDD) often elicits a spectrum of opinions.

People often joke about it and often have nothing interesting to say. More often than not, individuals use this opportunity to brag or express how much effort they are willing to put in to go the extra mile.\nPeople struggle to provide good answers to this question because they don’t often take the time to sit and think about their weaknesses. Growing involves being aware of these weaknesses, which is part of the path to becoming a better person.\nI ask this question during interview to understand if people are aware of the challenging aspects of working with them and, more importantly, if they are actively working to improve those situations. However, let me share mine.\nWhen I feel frustrated, my lack of trust and patience becomes evident in my work relationships, sometimes to the extent that it can affect the teams I work with and my leadership. In extreme cases, this frustration manifests as cynical behavior, typically directed at leadership after prolonged frustration from stagnation. I often mask it with dark humor, but I find relief through meditation and running to clear my mind of these thoughts. I encourage those working with me to call me out if they notice such behavior.\nInitially, these raw comments might seem brave, bold, or even revealing of some truth. However, they are often negative and lack actionable steps to steer things in the right direction, merely reflecting my frustration. Over time, this repetitive behavior drains people\u0026rsquo;s energy and leads them to view me as irritating and uncooperative.\nThe most troubling aspect of this weakness, and the reason I\u0026rsquo;m actively working on it, is that it contradicts who I aspire to be. My goal is to be a kind and empathetic leader, yet these frustrations lead to behaviors that directly oppose this goal. They put me in a position where my relationships are laden with negative thoughts, not only impacting how others perceive me but also harming the teams I work with and becoming the subjects of my thoughts.\nI\u0026rsquo;m working hard to ensure this doesn\u0026rsquo;t become a defining part of my identity, or at least not for prolonged periods. I acknowledge that some aspects of life or work are beyond my control, and frustration is inevitable. Nevertheless, I am committed to maintaining kindness and empathy even during these challenging times.\nUltimately, it\u0026rsquo;s acceptable to have weaknesses and actively work on improving them. If you believe you have none, it\u0026rsquo;s likely because you haven\u0026rsquo;t deeply reflected on it. None of us are perfect. By acknowledging weaknesses, we can minimize their impact. In the next interview, offering a concrete example of your weaknesses can provide the interviewer a glimpse into your growth journey toward becoming a better person.\nThe next time you have a moment for introspection, ask yourself about the most challenging aspect of working with you and what steps you can take to improve it. However, you must genuinely desire to uncover these answers by being open and honest with yourself.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/weakness/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What are your weaknesses?\u0026quot;—One of the most mocked questions in the interview process.

It is called the Individual Contributor path for a reason, no?\nWhile you may excel in your technical skills and abilities, it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember that most software engineering positions involve working with a team. Collaboration between developers, product managers, and designers can lead to better products and make you a valuable member of the team.\nTeamwork Series We can define Software Engineering as the union of people, processes, and products to enable the continuous delivery of value to our end users. There can be no promotion if the team does not grow with it.\n\u0026ldquo;Teamwork\u0026rdquo; is a series of posts where I will be sharing my learnings from topics surrounding working with teams like Team Cohesion, Coaching and Mentoring, Delegating and Sponsoring, and others from the perspective of an Engineering Manager. These tools will allow you to support and lead your tech team grow with you.\nTeam Cohesion In my first post, I will be talking about Team Cohesion especially working on agile development. Teamwork plays a crucial role in agile, an approach to software development that emphasizes continuous delivery, iterative development, and the ability to quickly respond to change.\nIn an agile team, everyone works together closely to create high-quality software products. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, teamwork and collaboration are one of the top skills that employers look for in job candidates. Therefore, to achieve success as a Software Engineer, you need to work well with others.\nFor everyone working together, team members need to click like pieces of a clock to move the arms in sync. But we are all different. We have different backgrounds, different personalities, and different ways of working. But, we need to find a way to coordinate our efforts in a direction that works for everyone despite our different strengths and weaknesses including unique ways of communicating, learning, and growing.\nWhat can the team do? There are times when team members might not be able to work together as a team. This is where the role of an Engineering Manager comes in. The Engineering Manager is responsible for ensuring that the team is working together effectively and efficiently. One of the most important skills that an Engineering Manager needs to have is to build team cohesion. Team cohesion is the degree to which team members are attracted to, motivated by, and committed to the team. It is the glue that holds the team together, and the reason why people stay in a team and work together to achieve a common goal. Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about some of the tools that could help you build team cohesion.\nTeam user manual One of the tools that an Engineering Manager can use to build team cohesion is the team user manual. The team user manual is a document that describes the team\u0026rsquo;s culture, values, and processes. It is a living document that is constantly updated and improved, and It is shared with all team members and stakeholders. It is a document that is used to onboard new team members and to help them understand the team\u0026rsquo;s culture and processes.\nThe process of building one requires the inclusion of all team members, and how do we achieve it? We need to start by asking all team members to write their user manuals. The manual describes the team member\u0026rsquo;s preferred way of working, communicating, learning, and growing. If you want to see an example of one, here is mine.\nOnce all team members have written their user manuals, the Engineering Manager needs to review them and consolidate them into one document. The document should be shared with all team members and stakeholders. It is important to note that the team user manual is not a static document. It is a living document that is constantly updated and improved.\nWe can describe the team user manual as the common set of rules that the team members follow to work together effectively and efficiently without stepping on each other\u0026rsquo;s toes or forcing others to change their ways of working. It deletes bias from leadership and includes everyone in the process of building the team.\nTeam Charter Another tool that an Engineering Manager can use to build team cohesion is the team charter. The team charter is a document that describes the team\u0026rsquo;s mission, vision, and values. It is another living document that is constantly updated and improved, and It is shared with all team members and stakeholders. The team charter is built with the input of the 3 main users of a team: the team members, the stakeholders, and the customers.\nThe sections of this document include the purpose of the team, the team\u0026rsquo;s mission statement, the team\u0026rsquo;s values, and the engineering principles to follow in the software engineering process. It should describe who are the customers and the market research done to understand their needs. You can also include the structure of the team and relevant information like the team user manual.\nFinally, it roadmaps the strategy and the actions the team will take in the next 3 to 6 months to solve these needs. One of the most efficient ways to drive this effort is with the Object Key Results methodology.\nThis document is a living document that is constantly updated and improved when any of its parts pivots or there are new learnings from the customers. It is a document that is used to onboard new team members and to help them understand the team\u0026rsquo;s mission, vision, and values. It is also used to communicate with stakeholders and customers about the team\u0026rsquo;s strategy and the actions the team will take. The Team Charter connects the stakeholders, the customers, and the team members on a common goal.\nTeam Roadmap Now that we know the rules of the team and the team\u0026rsquo;s purpose, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the product that they build. To build cohesion in the team, the team members need to know what they are working on and what they are planning to do next. We split this into blocks of work called sprints.\nThis is where the team roadmap comes in. The team roadmap is a document that describes the team\u0026rsquo;s product strategy and the actions the team will take in the next release to improve the product they are working on.\nWith the roadmap, we can estimate the amount of work the team will be able to deliver for each sprint. We can also estimate the amount of time it will take to deliver the features. It also helps the stakeholders to understand the team\u0026rsquo;s progress and to know what they can expect from the team in the next release.\nAt any given moment every team member can read the roadmap and understand the priorities the team has and what is the next most valuable thing to work on. The roadmap also helps the leadership of the team surface any blockers or risks that might prevent the team from delivering the features on time. It also helps them set confidence levels for the team\u0026rsquo;s progress.\nEffective Communication Something worst than not collaborating is collaborating poorly. Effective communication is the key to building team cohesion. It is the key to building trust and making sure that everyone is on the same page, and making sure that everyone is working on the most valuable thing to work on.\nWe need to communicate in a way that is clear, concise, and actionable.\nSet clear expectations: Ensure that everyone on the team understands their roles and responsibilities and the expected outcomes. This helps to avoid misunderstandings and ensures that everyone is working towards the same goals.\nFoster an open-door policy: Encourage team members to approach each other with any questions or concerns they may have. Creating a safe environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas is crucial for effective collaboration.\nUse the right communication channels: Different situations call for different communication channels. For example, instant messaging may be more appropriate for quick questions or asynchronous updates, while synchronous meetings may be better for more detailed information and discussions. Utilizing the appropriate communication channels can help to ensure that messages are delivered and received promptly.\nPractice active listening: Communication is a two-way street, and effective listening is just as important as effective speaking. Encourage team members to actively listen to each other, ask clarifying questions, and provide feedback.\nProvide regular updates: Regular check-ins can help to keep everyone informed of the team\u0026rsquo;s progress and any changes in direction. This helps to avoid surprises and allows team members to adjust their work accordingly.\nConclusion In this post, we talked about the importance of team cohesion in agile development. We also talked about the tools that you can use to build team cohesion and grow the team around you. To collaborate effectively we need to understand who we are, how we want to work, what are the most valuable objectives to work on, and how are we going to communicate to update each other. In my next post, I will be talking about Coaching and Mentoring and how to do it effectively. I will also be talking about the different types of coaching and mentoring and how to choose the right one for your team.\nReferences The Agile Manifesto Developing and Sustaining High-Performance Work Teams The 5 Dysfunctions of a Team ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/teamwork-collaboration/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMany times as a Software Engineer you might have realized you grown your toolset of skills and feel you deserve a promotion.

We want to deliver value to our customers, but we also need to maintain the health of our systems and the wellbeing of our teams. It\u0026rsquo;s a delicate balancing act, and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to feel like we\u0026rsquo;re always falling short in one area or another. I decided to break down patterns I\u0026rsquo;ve encountered over the years building teams, and I\u0026rsquo;ve realized that there are two distinct modes that teams operate in: Delivery Mode and Rescue Mode.\nThe idea of spliting the team modes into two came from reading the book The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz. In the book, Horowitz talks about the difference between running a company during good times and running a company during bad times. He argues that management techniques must flip entirely depending on the context.\nPeacetime CEO: Focuses on culture, fostering creativity, and minimizing conflict. They have the luxury of time to build consensus. Wartime CEO: Focuses on the prime directive (market survival). They care little about feelings or consensus; they care about the strict adherence to the path that leads to safety. An engineering manager must similarly toggle their style, being an empathetic coach in Peace (Delivery Mode) and a directive commander in War (Rescue Mode).\nTrying to apply the same tools, processes, and leadership style to every situation leads to frustration: sprint planning feels bureaucratic during a production outage, and incident style urgency burns people out when applied to routine feature work. The reality is that each mode demands a different point of view and a different set of levers.\nBy explicitly naming Delivery Mode and Rescue Mode, you gain clarity:\nRight tool for the job: Instead of forcing one process to cover all scenarios, you can adopt tools and rituals purpose built for each context. OKRs and sprint planning for Delivery, incident command and war rooms for Rescue. Faster mode recognition: Once you learn to identify which mode you\u0026rsquo;re in, you stop wasting time applying the wrong playbook. The question shifts from \u0026ldquo;why isn\u0026rsquo;t this working?\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;which mode are we in, and what does that mode require?\u0026rdquo; Reduced cognitive load: Your team can relax into the current mode\u0026rsquo;s expectations instead of constantly renegotiating how to work. The goal isn\u0026rsquo;t to eliminate Rescue Mode since some level of crisis is inevitable. The goal is to know which mode you\u0026rsquo;re in, apply the right approach, and transition cleanly when circumstances change. This document is designed to help you do exactly that.\nIn the sections that follow, we\u0026rsquo;ll define each mode in detail, what triggers it, what success looks like, and what leadership behaviors it demands. We\u0026rsquo;ll also explore the \u0026ldquo;burst capacity\u0026rdquo; model (how much Rescue Mode a team can absorb before burning out), dependency management (why other teams\u0026rsquo; crises become yours), and practical checklists for transitioning between modes. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re currently firefighting or enjoying a calm sprint, this framework will give you a shared vocabulary and a playbook for both.\nCore Concepts Delivery Mode: Sustainable Growth The default state. Validating the path, optimizing the machine, and growing the team.\nIn Delivery Mode, the backlog is clear, and the environment is predictable. Leadership focuses on long-term sustainability, career growth, and system hygiene.\nAspect Description Primary Objective Deliver roadmap value sustainably Mindset Thoughtful, predictable, optimize for long-term throughput Operating Constraints Keep work predictable; protect focus time Typical Signals Stable on-call, known backlog, low \u0026ldquo;unknown unknowns\u0026rdquo; Success Metrics Velocity, capacity, quality, predictability Key Activities:\nDelivery \u0026amp; Planning: Sprint execution, OKRs, capacity/velocity management People \u0026amp; Org: Onboarding, coaching/mentoring, performance cycles, hiring Technical Excellence: System design reviews, refactoring, dev lifecycle improvements, TDD Learning \u0026amp; Leverage: Stretch goals, deliberate learning, platform investments that compound Artifacts: Plans/OKRs, design reviews, career plans, tech debt strategy, hiring plan Rescue Mode: Crisis Response The exception state. High operational intensity, unknown territories, and immediate survival.\nIn Rescue Mode, the team faces perceived chaos due toincidents, security threats, or existential business deadlines. The path is unclear or obstructed, and the standard process is often too slow.\nAspect Description Primary Objective Restore service/safety fast, reduce blast radius, return to Delivery Mode Mindset Alert, decisive, action-oriented Operating Constraints Context switching is expensive; comms must be tight Typical Signals Sev-0/1, active exploit/CVE, outage, major regression, urgent escalations Success Metrics MTTD, MTTR, customer impact containment Key Activities:\nReliability Incidents: Sev-0/1 response, on-call escalations, detection + recovery Security Response: CVEs, active threats, emergency patching/mitigations Operational Interrupts: Urgent support escalations, after-hours stabilization Business-Critical Crunch: \u0026ldquo;Do-or-die\u0026rdquo; moments, funding deadlines, existential customer impact Artifacts: Incident timeline, decision log, status updates, postmortem + follow-ups The Burst Capacity Model Every team has a burst capacity for Rescue Mode similar to AWS EBS burst credits.\nKey Principles Finite Resource: Teams cannot sustain Rescue Mode indefinitely without burning out Recovery Time Required: After Rescue Mode, teams need Delivery time to recover and recharge Predictability Trade-off: Too much Rescue Mode erodes stability, morale, and predictability Cannot Be Cut: Rescue Mode work takes as long as it takes—you cannot artificially constrain it Warning Signs of Burnout Decreased velocity in Delivery Mode Increased employee turnover Declining code quality Reduced engagement in planning activities More incidents (creating a negative feedback loop) Critical Success Factors For Rescue Mode Success Factor Description Trust Team members must trust each other\u0026rsquo;s technical judgment under pressure Tooling Automated detection, deployment, rollback, and monitoring reduce MTTR Onboarding Every team member must be fully onboarded to contribute during crises Focus Eliminate all distractions outside the critical task Clear Communication Defined incident commander roles and communication protocols DORA Metrics for Rescue Mode:\nMTTR (Mean Time to Recovery): How quickly can you restore service? MTTD (Mean Time to Detection): How quickly do you identify issues? For Delivery Mode Success Factor Description Rhythm and Ritual Establish sustainable work patterns and ceremonies Automation Automate toil work to maximize time for business value Capacity Planning Realistic estimation accounting for potential Rescue Mode interruptions Career Investment Dedicate time to mentoring, feedback, and development Technical Excellence Pay down debt proactively to prevent future incidents Dependency Management and System Resilience Critical Principle: A system is only as strong as its weakest link (internal or external).\nThe Dependency Problem Your team\u0026rsquo;s Rescue Mode frequency is affected by:\nNumber of dependencies on external services Hardness of coupling (hard vs. soft dependencies) Resilience patterns implemented (circuit breakers, timeouts, graceful degradation) Example Scenario Your service displays customer data including \u0026ldquo;last 3 orders\u0026rdquo; from an external Orders service:\nDependency Type Behavior Your Mode Hard Dependency Orders service down → Your service appears down Enter Rescue Mode Soft Dependency Orders service down → Your service shows data without orders Remain in Delivery Mode Mitigation Strategies Make non-critical attributes optional Implement circuit breakers and fallbacks Cache data for resilience Design for graceful degradation Establish clear SLA expectations with dependency owners Incident Command Structure Use an incident command structure so the team can execute without everyone trying to lead at once:\nRole Responsibility Incident Commander (IC) Owns decisions + keeps the incident moving Comms Lead Stakeholder/customer updates, keeps noise off responders Ops/Tech Lead(s) Directs technical investigation and mitigations Scribe Timeline + decisions + actions captured live Exit Criteria (\u0026ldquo;Back to Delivery\u0026rdquo; Checklist) Customer impact stopped or bounded Monitoring confirms stability trend Short-term mitigation in place (even if root cause isn\u0026rsquo;t fully fixed) Postmortem scheduled and owners assigned Leadership Responsibilities by Mode Delivery Mode Leadership ✓ Focus on career development and growth opportunities ✓ Maintain predictable velocity and capacity planning ✓ Work on team alignment and priority setting ✓ Invest in automation and toil reduction ✓ Build resilience through architecture and tooling ✓ Create psychological safety and trust ✓ Hire and onboard effectively ✓ Review and optimize processes Rescue Mode Leadership ✓ Define clear success criteria for resolution ✓ Identify steps to return to Delivery Mode ✓ Remove obstacles and distractions ✓ Communicate status to stakeholders ✓ Ensure proper incident command structure ✓ Monitor team energy and prevent burnout ✓ Document decisions for AAR ✓ Shield team from external pressure Post Rescue Mode Leadership ✓ Conduct After-Action Reviews (AAR) and postmortems ✓ Identify root causes and prevention measures ✓ Update runbooks and tooling ✓ Give team recovery time ✓ Recognize contributions and effort ✓ Implement improvements to reduce future occurrence Communicating Mode Transitions Clear communication during mode transitions prevents confusion and sets expectations. Ambiguity about \u0026ldquo;are we in incident mode or not?\u0026rdquo; leads to half-measures and delayed responses.\nEntering Rescue Mode (Delivery → Rescue) To the Team:\nExplicit declaration: \u0026ldquo;We are now in Rescue Mode. [Brief description of the trigger].\u0026rdquo; Assign roles immediately: \u0026ldquo;IC is [name], Comms is [name].\u0026rdquo; State the success criteria: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re done when [X metric is restored / customer impact is stopped].\u0026rdquo; Clear expectation shift: \u0026ldquo;All sprint work is paused. Focus only on this.\u0026rdquo; To Stakeholders:\nUse a standing incident communication template:\n\u0026ldquo;We have identified [issue]. Impact: [scope]. Current status: [investigating/mitigating]. Next update in [30 min].\u0026rdquo; Over-communicate cadence, under-communicate speculation. Exiting Rescue Mode (Rescue → Delivery) To the Team:\nExplicit stand-down: \u0026ldquo;We are exiting Rescue Mode. The immediate threat is contained.\u0026rdquo; Acknowledge the work: Quick recognition of effort before moving on. Set recovery expectations: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re resuming sprint work tomorrow. Today is buffer/decompression.\u0026rdquo; Schedule the postmortem: \u0026ldquo;Postmortem is [date]. Action items will flow into the backlog.\u0026rdquo; To Stakeholders:\nFinal incident summary:\n\u0026ldquo;Issue resolved at [time]. Root cause: [brief]. Customer impact: [duration/scope]. Follow-up postmortem scheduled.\u0026rdquo; Rituals That Reinforce Mode Awareness Ritual Purpose Status channel A single #team-status channel where mode is always visible (\u0026quot;🟢 Delivery\u0026quot; or \u0026ldquo;🔴 Rescue: [incident link]\u0026rdquo;) Standup framing Start every standup with \u0026ldquo;We are in [Mode].\u0026rdquo; Reinforces shared awareness. Calendar block When entering Rescue Mode, IC or manager cancels/postpones non-essential meetings for the team. Post Incident Follow Through A postmortem without owners and dates becomes a diary. The value of Rescue Mode isn\u0026rsquo;t just surviving the incident—it\u0026rsquo;s learning from it so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen again.\nThe Postmortem Checklist Every postmortem should produce:\nOutput Description Timeline What happened, when, and who did what. Facts only, no blame. Root Cause(s) The underlying issue(s), not just the trigger. Use \u0026ldquo;5 Whys\u0026rdquo; or similar. Contributing Factors What made detection slower or impact larger? Action Items Concrete tasks with owners and due dates. What Went Well Reinforce behaviors you want repeated. Tying Actions to the Backlog Postmortem action items must flow into your tracked work system (Jira, Linear, etc.):\nCreate tickets immediately — Don\u0026rsquo;t wait. Do it in the postmortem meeting. Tag them consistently — Use a label like postmortem or incident follow up for visibility. Assign owners, not teams — \u0026ldquo;Team X will fix this\u0026rdquo; means no one will fix this. Set realistic due dates — Balance urgency against current Delivery Mode capacity. Review in sprint planning — Postmortem items compete for capacity like any other work. Follow Through Rituals Ritual Purpose Postmortem review meeting 48-72 hours after incident. Fresh enough to remember, calm enough to think. Action item standup tag Weekly check: \u0026ldquo;Any postmortem items blocked or at risk?\u0026rdquo; Monthly incident review Leadership reviews open postmortem actions. Escalates stale items. Quarterly retro Are we seeing repeat patterns? Is our prevention investment working? Anti-Patterns to Avoid Postmortem delayed indefinitely — Schedule it before closing the incident. Actions without owners — If no one owns it, it won\u0026rsquo;t happen. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll be more careful\u0026rdquo; — Not an action. What system change prevents recurrence? 100-item action list — Pick the 3-5 highest-leverage items. The rest goes to tech debt backlog. Blame culture — If people fear punishment, they\u0026rsquo;ll hide information. You\u0026rsquo;ll learn nothing. Team Maturity Assessment How do you know if your team is actually good at operating in both modes? Maturity isn\u0026rsquo;t about never entering Rescue Mode but how smoothly you operate in each mode and how gracefully you transition between them.\nUse this framework to assess where your team stands and where to invest.\nRescue Mode Effectiveness A mature team in Rescue Mode doesn\u0026rsquo;t panic. They\u0026rsquo;ve built the muscle memory and tooling to respond quickly without chaos. Assess your team on:\nDimension What to Look For Speed of detection and response How long between \u0026ldquo;something is wrong\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re actively working on it\u0026rdquo;? MTTD and MTTR are your primary signals. Quality of communication Are stakeholders informed without responders being interrupted? Is there a single source of truth? Ability to execute under pressure Does the team fragment or unite? Do people know their roles, or is there confusion about who decides what? Post-incident learning Do postmortems happen? Do actions get completed? Are you seeing fewer repeat incidents over time? Red flags: Finger-pointing during incidents, no clear IC, stakeholders pinging individual engineers for status, repeat incidents on the same root cause.\nDelivery Mode Effectiveness A mature team in Delivery Mode operates predictably and sustainably. They\u0026rsquo;re not just shipping—they\u0026rsquo;re building capability for the future. Assess your team on:\nDimension What to Look For Consistent velocity and predictability Can you forecast what will ship this sprint with reasonable accuracy? Or is every sprint a surprise? Proactive debt management Is tech debt addressed intentionally, or only when it causes outages? Do you have a debt backlog? Career development culture Are 1:1s happening? Are people growing? Do ICs have visibility into their path forward? Low unplanned work percentage What fraction of your sprint is reactive vs. planned? High unplanned work erodes trust and predictability. Red flags: \u0026ldquo;We never have time for refactoring,\u0026rdquo; cancelled 1:1s, engineers surprised by their performance reviews, constant scope creep.\nWhat Mature Teams Look Like Rescue Mode is a calm workflow, not a panic. Roles are clear, runbooks exist, and people trust each other. Most time is spent in Delivery Mode. Rescue Mode is the exception, not the norm. Rescue Mode frequency is decreasing over time. Prevention investments are paying off. DORA metrics trend positively. Deployment frequency up, lead time down, change failure rate down, MTTR down. The team can articulate which mode they\u0026rsquo;re in. Shared vocabulary exists and is used. Common Pitfalls and Anti-Patterns Attempting to Budget Rescue Mode Work \u0026ldquo;Ops days\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;on-call effort\u0026rdquo; percentages are estimates at best Rescue Mode work cannot be cut due to time constraints Attempting to time-box critical incidents leads to poor outcomes Treating All Work as Delivery Mode Applying standard planning processes during crises creates delays Requiring extensive documentation before action during incidents Not recognizing when to shift gears Operating in Permanent Rescue Mode Treating every task as urgent undermines true priorities Team burnout and turnover No time for strategic improvements Accumulating technical debt Ignoring Post-Rescue Recovery Immediately returning to normal sprint work without reflection No AAR or postmortem process Missing opportunities for prevention Team exhaustion accumulates Final Tips Engineering leadership requires fluency in both Delivery and Rescue modes. Success comes from:\nBuilding trust and capability during Delivery Mode to enable effective Rescue Mode response Investing in tooling and automation to reduce toil and improve MTTR/MTTD Managing dependencies to prevent cascading failures Creating sustainable rhythms that allow for recovery and growth Learning continuously from incidents to prevent recurrence The most mature teams minimize time in Rescue Mode through prevention while maintaining the capability to execute effectively when crises occur. Your role as a leader is to create the conditions for both modes to succeed without burning out your team.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/team-modes/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAs engineering leaders, we are constantly juggling competing priorities. We want to deliver value to our customers, but we also need to maintain the health of our systems and the wellbeing of our teams. It\u0026rsquo;s a delicate balancing act, and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to feel like we\u0026rsquo;re always falling short in one area or another. I decided to break down patterns I\u0026rsquo;ve encountered over the years building teams, and I\u0026rsquo;ve realized that there are two distinct modes that teams operate in: Delivery Mode and Rescue Mode.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Team Modes: Delivery Mode vs. Rescue Mode"},{"content":"I know this is a delicate topic to talk about, but I wanted to share my personal experience and opinion. The conversation around Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) seems to be very binary, either \u0026ldquo;force people to hire diversity no matter the cost\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;just hire the most qualified person.\u0026rdquo; In a domain where it is never black and white, this polarized approach feels wrong. Like every polarized conversation, it divides people, causing them to defend their positions and attack those who think differently. DEI plays a role in a very grey and biased ecosystem, which is hiring, and you cannot have polarized policies or opinions when it comes to who you are working with.\nDEI comes from the idea that a diverse group of experiences can yield better results when your job is to solve problems that affect all of us. My organization embedded it throughout the entire employee lifecycle—from hiring to promotion and raises. We trained ourselves to remove as much bias as we could to make the best decisions based on merit and skill. In software development, this strategy can be seen in how we consider disabilities, symbolism, and the organization of different points of view.\nI want to share my perspective, shaped by my own experience working within an organization that successfully embraced a thoughtful DEI framework. This is a delicate topic, but it’s one that benefits immensely from kindness and empathy.\nEliminating Bias, Not Lowering the Bar In my opinion, the true power of effective DEI programs is not to \u0026ldquo;quota\u0026rdquo; the teams you build, but to relentlessly expose and eliminate bias in the hiring teams themselves. DEI reduces bias by helping hiring teams pay attention to what really matters, not what feels more comfortable.\nWe cannot deny that it\u0026rsquo;s human nature to feel safer in spaces where there are people like us. When tasked with choosing a new colleague, the unconscious default is often to select someone who mirrors our own characteristics, especially if we fail to examine our own judgment biases.\nThe phrase \u0026ldquo;just hire the most qualified person\u0026rdquo; reveals to me a fundamental misunderstanding of the hiring process. Hiring is a very vague journey where the goal is to find a qualified person who can successfully do the job in a reasonable time, not magically identify the single \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; employee, particularly when the decision is filtered through a few hours of conversation with a handful of biased teammates.\nThis vague hiring process is where DEI plays a crucial role to eliminate biases as much as we can so that any candidate with the right skills is not disadvantaged by characteristics that might make them less appealing to the hiring team\u0026rsquo;s unconscious preferences. Since minorities are more likely to encounter this bias as problematic, DEI addresses this by reducing bias during the process.\nThe Business of Hiring: Acknowledging the Grey The hiring ecosystem is a mix of grey. The bright line that should never be crossed is where we lower the bar for hiring because we are not getting enough diversity in our interviewee groups. Hiring is also a business decision that should take into consideration skills and merit. I am sure people want to be hired based on their merit, not their identity—which has not changed since they were born.\nIf your hiring process is successful, you\u0026rsquo;ll often get multiple people who are qualified for the job. In this case, choosing randomly would yield a similar outcome to spending a lot more effort trying to determine who is marginally more qualified. This is also an opportunity to organize the team with the new hire in mind, introducing a member who will not only bring the required skills but also bridge experience gaps that exist in the team.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s be honest—a normal hiring process looks more like the secretary problem than choosing the local maximum.\nThe Representation Question Most people would agree that when we talk about fighting for more representation, we\u0026rsquo;re not talking about entry-level jobs but those roles that can really steer the ship of an organization. For the past few decades in tech, we have seen many of these positions filled by a specific group of people, leaving us with the question: \u0026ldquo;Is there a more diverse way to lead?\u0026rdquo;\nTo answer this, we need to dive deeper into the representation of individuals who studied tech 30 years ago, which was not very diverse. That distribution is compounded by the level of stress and endurance someone needs to have to rise to that level of leadership. These positions are not something I would be able to take on. In my opinion, these positions are too much for one person, but there are people willing to take them on and absorb the responsibilities that entail.\nI am hopeful that more diverse groups are coming out of universities and entering the job market, and we will see in 30 years a more diverse group of C-level executives and directors than we see today, improving the representation people are hoping for.\nMoving Forward with Kindness The need for robust DEI programs was created by decades of systemic and cultural trends in the workforce. We need to focus on understanding what happened and what is currently happening, rather than resorting to blame and pointing fingers.\nWe are a group of individuals with complex lives trying to find a space to explore our skills alongside other people who have their own complex lives. We can choose to be kind to each other. In my personal experience, more diverse teams tend to be more kind and understanding with others than teams where everyone shares the same background.\nDEI\u0026rsquo;s strength is not about forcing anyone to fill a quota of diversity. It\u0026rsquo;s about recognizing our human tendency to gravitate toward similarity and providing tools to ensure we\u0026rsquo;re making decisions based on skills, merit, and potential rather than unconscious comfort with familiarity.\nLet us commit to kindness, empathy, and the continuous, difficult work of reducing bias. When we do this, we don\u0026rsquo;t compromise merit. We clarify it, ensuring that true skill is what ultimately prevails.\nAlways be kind.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/dei-use-case/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI know this is a delicate topic to talk about, but I wanted to share my personal experience and opinion.

It is called the Individual Contributor path for a reason, no?\nWhile you may excel in your technical skills and abilities, it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember that most software engineering positions involve working with a team.

There can be no promotion if the team does not grow with it.\n\u0026ldquo;Teamwork\u0026rdquo; is a series of posts where I will be sharing my learnings from topics surrounding working with teams like Team Cohesion, Coaching and Mentoring, Delegating and Sponsoring, and others from the perspective of an Engineering Manager. These tools will allow you to support and lead your tech team grow with you.\nDelegating and Sponsoring In the dynamic world of software engineering, effective leadership transcends beyond just managing tasks and projects. It involves mastering the arts of delegation and sponsorship \u0026ndash; two pivotal skills that can significantly enhance team performance, foster professional growth, and drive innovation.\nUnderstanding when and how to delegate tasks, as well as how to sponsor and advocate for your team members, can set you apart as a leader in the tech industry. Delegation and sponsorship share some similarities in their focus on developing team members and enhancing team performance, but they also have distinct differences in their approach and objectives.\nDelegating Delegation is more than just assigning tasks; it\u0026rsquo;s entrusting responsibility and authority to team members to complete those tasks. It\u0026rsquo;s a strategic tool that enables leaders to manage their workload more efficiently, while simultaneously empowering team members, enhancing their skills, and fostering a sense of trust and accountability within the team.\nDelegation empowers team members by entrusting them with important tasks, which boosts their confidence and engagement. It allows team members to develop new skills and expertise, preparing them for more significant roles in the future. And by delegating, leaders can distribute workloads more evenly, ensuring that tasks are completed by those with the most appropriate skills and bandwidth.\nDelegate Effectively Effective delegation requires choosing the right tasks to delegate, selecting the appropriate team members based on their skills and development needs, providing clear instructions, and offering support and feedback throughout the process.\nChoose the Right Tasks: Not all tasks are suitable for delegation. Choose tasks that contribute to team members\u0026rsquo; growth and are aligned with their skills and career aspirations. Select the Right People: Consider the skills, interests, and developmental needs of your team members when delegating tasks. Provide Clear Expectations: Clearly communicate the task objectives, deadlines, and any relevant information to ensure understanding and alignment. Empower with Authority: Ensure that team members have the authority and resources they need to complete the task successfully. Monitor Progress and Provide Feedback: Check in periodically to monitor progress, offer guidance, and provide constructive feedback. Sponsorship Sponsorship goes beyond mentorship; it involves actively advocating for and investing in the professional development of team members. A sponsor not only offers guidance and support but also uses their influence to open doors and create opportunities for those they sponsor.\nSponsors use their influence to open doors, provide high-profile opportunities, and ensure that the accomplishments and potential of the individuals they support are recognized at decision-making levels.\nSponsorship can play a critical role in the career advancement of team members by providing them with visibility and opportunities. Feeling supported and having clear career advancement opportunities can significantly improve team member retention. Effective sponsorship can help break down barriers and promote diversity and inclusion within leadership roles.\nSponsor Effectively This role is crucial for career development and often involves a personal commitment to the sponsored individual\u0026rsquo;s success, making it a powerful tool for promoting talent within the organization, especially for underrepresented groups.\nIdentify Talent: Look for team members who show potential, commitment, and a drive to grow within the company. Provide Opportunities: Offer challenging projects, introduce them to key stakeholders, and involve them in high-visibility tasks. Advocate: Use your influence to advocate for your protégés, recommending them for promotions, recognitions, and important assignments. Offer Guidance: Provide constructive feedback and advice to help them navigate their career paths and professional challenges. Support Their Visibility: Ensure that the achievements and potential of those you sponsor are visible to senior leadership. Differences Though both delegation and sponsorship aim to develop team members and enhance team performance, they differ in several key aspects:\nScope and Focus: Delegation is task-oriented; it\u0026rsquo;s about assigning specific tasks or projects to team members. Sponsorship is relationship-oriented, focusing on the long-term career development of the individual and often involves a personal commitment to their success.\nLevel of Involvement: In delegation, once a task is assigned, the leader typically steps back, providing guidance and support as needed but allowing the team member to take ownership. In sponsorship, the leader is actively involved in advocating for the individual\u0026rsquo;s career advancement, which includes creating opportunities and promoting their achievements within the organization.\nVisibility: Delegation primarily operates within the context of the team or project, with the delegated tasks and outcomes being visible to the immediate team or department. Sponsorship aims to increase the individual\u0026rsquo;s visibility on a broader scale, often involving senior leadership and decision-makers across the organization.\nObjective: The primary objective of delegation is to enhance efficiency and team capability, ensuring that the right tasks are matched with the right skills, and leaders can focus on strategic areas. Sponsorship, however, is primarily focused on advancing the individual\u0026rsquo;s career, helping them to secure promotions, gain new experiences, and enhance their professional network.\nConclusion As a leader in software engineering, balancing delegation and sponsorship is key to developing a high-performing, motivated, and loyal team. Delegation helps in building a self-reliant team capable of handling tasks with minimal supervision, while sponsorship ensures team members have the opportunities and support they need to advance their careers.\nBy mastering these two essential skills, you not only enhance your leadership capabilities but also contribute to creating an empowering and inclusive work environment that values growth, innovation, and diversity. Remember, the success of your team is a reflection of your success as a leader.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/delegating-sponsoring/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMany times as a Software Engineer you might have realized you grown your toolset of skills and feel you deserve a promotion.

These tools will allow you to support and lead your tech team grow with you.\nMentoring and Coaching In this post, I want to talk about the differences and practical approach to mentor and coach. Even though they are similar, they are situational depending not only on the person you are working with but your own experience and needs of the individual. We can define mentoring as the act of sharing your experience and knowledge with someone to create a learning environment. On the other hand, coaching is the act of guiding someone with open question to find the answers to their own questions.\nMy learnings During early times as an engineering manager at Pivotal, I had the opportunity to meet Lara Hogan, author of the book Resilient Management. In this book, she talks about the different tools you have as a leader to help your team grow.\nThis book and her working sessions helped me understand the difference between mentoring and coaching, and the difference between being encouraging and being direct when it comes to the interactions you have with reports about their work. In this post I will focus on the first part, mentoring and coaching.\nWhat is mentorship? The goal of mentorship is to bring a different perspective to the subject of a topic you have experience with. Usually you explain by example what you did in their position and what was the tradeoff you observed and let the subject absorb and assimilate the situation they are in with your story.\nIn order to mentor you need experience in the field of the mentee’s problem. If this is not a possibility, you might need to find someone in the team that could mentor the person.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s coaching? Coaching is when you navigate the subject in their own thoughts and help them ask the right questions so they map the path from the problem to the possible solutions. You create the environment so that the individual can get the right information from their own experience.\nThis is why if you are an expert of the domain you might lean the questions to your past experiences and deviate from the individual experience and thoughts. It is easier to coach when you do not know the domain of the person you are coaching.\nWhat to keep in mind while mentoring and coaching When mentoring and coaching, it is important to keep in mind the following key points:\nFeedback. Providing feedback is an important part of coaching and mentoring. You should provide constructive feedback that helps the individual improve and grow.\nEmpathy. It is important to be empathetic when coaching or mentoring someone. You need to understand their perspective and be supportive of their goals and aspirations.\nGoal Setting. Coaching and Mentoring are about helping the individual set and achieve their goals. You should help them identify their goals and come up with a plan to achieve them.\nAccountability. You should hold the individual accountable for their actions and help them stay on track with their goals.\nTrust. Building trust is crucial when coaching or mentoring someone. You need to create a safe and supportive environment where the individual feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and experiences.\nCoaching Key Points When coaching someone, particularly in a professional setting, there are several key points to pay attention to ensure the process is effective and beneficial for the individual being coached. Here are some crucial aspects to consider:\nActive Listening. This is the most important aspect of coaching. You need to listen to the person you are coaching and understand their perspective. This will help you ask the right questions and guide them in the right direction.\nOpen-Ended Questions. When coaching, you should ask open-ended questions that encourage the individual to think and reflect on their experiences. This will help them come up with their own solutions and ideas.\nMentoring Key Points Mentoring is different from coaching in that it is more about sharing your experiences and knowledge with the individual. Here are some key points to consider when mentoring someone:\nSharing Experiences. Mentoring is about sharing your experiences and knowledge with the individual. You should provide guidance and advice based on your own experiences.\nRole Modeling. As a mentor, you should be a role model for the individual. You should demonstrate the behaviors and skills that you want the individual to develop.\nSupport. Mentoring is about providing support and guidance to the individual. You should be there to help them navigate their challenges and achieve their goals.\nA Practical approach | The Framework Like most problems of two variables, we can create a 2x2 table to help us understand when to use mentoring and coaching.\nYou know the domain You don\u0026rsquo;t know the domain The individual knows the domain Mentor/Coach Coach The individual doesn\u0026rsquo;t know the domain Mentor Coach You don\u0026rsquo;t know the domain and the individual knows the domain The advice is to coach. This might the best situation for bias since you are not an expert in the domain they need help with.\nEven if the coachee is more knowledgeable in a certain area, a coach can still facilitate growth and development by asking powerful questions, providing feedback, and helping the coachee explore new perspectives and solutions.\nYou know the domain and the individual doesn\u0026rsquo;t know the domain The advice is to mentor. You can share your experiences and knowledge with the individual to help them grow and develop in the domain they are not familiar with.\nYou can provide specific guidance, share knowledge, and offer advice based on their expertise, which is particularly beneficial for someone less experienced in the domain.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t know the domain and the individual doesn\u0026rsquo;t know the domain The advice is to coach.\nWhen both parties are less experienced in a specific domain, you can still effectively support the individual\u0026rsquo;s development through goal setting, accountability, and facilitating self-discovery, rather than direct knowledge transfer.\nYou know the domain and the individual knows the domain In this scenario you are advice to utilize advanced mentoring or coaching and peer mentoring.\nIn scenarios where both parties are highly experienced, the relationship can focus on advanced or niche topics by coaching or mentoring the details, with the possibility of mutual learning (peer mentoring).\nConclusion Mentoring and coaching are both important tools for helping individuals grow and develop. They are similar in many ways, but they are also different and should be used in different situations. By understanding the differences between mentoring and coaching, and when to use each, you can effectively support the growth and development of the individuals you work with.\nIn the next post, I will be talking about the importance of Delegating and Sponsoring in the growth of your team.\nReferences Resilient Management by Lara Hogan.

Some view it as a hindrance, others as the solution. And, like every extreme opinion about any topic, it is wrong to think in absolutes, we are not Sith.\nMy journey with TDD began with Kent Beck\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026ldquo;Test Driven Development by Example,\u0026rdquo; during my Ruby on Rails learning phase. Here, I share my insights, hoping to demystify TDD and its practicality in software development.\nCommon Misconceptions about TDD I have made a lot of mistakes while learning TDD, and like others, I have had misconceptions about it like:\nTest Coverage and the overuse of Unit Tests TDD is not about achieving 100% test coverage or exhausting yourself with unit tests. It\u0026rsquo;s about driving the key aspects like public contracts and business logic, primarily in the Service and API layers, with tests. Overemphasis on test coverage as a code health metric is misleading. Instead, focus on code behavior.\nYou should test what users care about not how the code is written.\nOver-Isolation in Testing Test isolation is crucial, but it\u0026rsquo;s about ensuring tests don\u0026rsquo;t interfere with each other, not excessively mocking dependencies. Over-mocking can lead to missed dependency updates.\nTDD and Clarity of Purpose TDD is most effective when you have a clear understanding of what you\u0026rsquo;re developing. If the project\u0026rsquo;s direction is unclear, it\u0026rsquo;s better to return to the planning stage rather than jump straight into coding. Testing a tool that helps you write better code, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a substitute for good design.\nTesting for User-Centric Behavior Focus your tests on what matters to users, not on the intricacies of code implementation. TDD helps in validating the correctness and behavior of applications, offering rapid and reliable feedback throughout the software lifecycle.\nTesting and Non-functional requirements When refactoring or dealing with performance and implementation changes, breaking tests can indicate either a shift in logic or a flaw in the test itself. Effective Refactoring should guide you to improve code without altering its behavior, and effective TDD focus on aligning with user needs rather than implementation specifics.\nTDD in System Design TDD is closely linked with system design more than the implmentation details of your application. It\u0026rsquo;s a cycle of understanding new requirements, designing solutions, writing tests to validate these designs, and then coding to fulfill them. TDD is not just about writing software; it\u0026rsquo;s about ensuring that software aligns with user needs and system requirements.\nThe Future of TDD For me, this is one of the areas where Artificial Inteligence can help developers build better software as a testing companion for each project. AI can significantly enhance TDD by automating the generation of test cases. Machine learning algorithms can analyze code and generate tests that cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases that developers might not anticipate. This automation can lead to more thorough and efficient testing processes.\nTest Driven Development is not a panacea, nor is it a stumbling block. It\u0026rsquo;s a tool for creating reliable, user-focused software. It prompts us to test behaviors that matter and avoid getting bogged down in implementation details. Embracing TDD means embracing a mindset of continuous improvement and clear focus on what truly benefits the end-user.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/test-drive-development/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn the realm of software development, Test-Driven Development (TDD) often elicits a spectrum of opinions.

People often joke about it and often have nothing interesting to say. More often than not, individuals use this opportunity to brag or express how much effort they are willing to put in to go the extra mile.\nPeople struggle to provide good answers to this question because they don’t often take the time to sit and think about their weaknesses. Growing involves being aware of these weaknesses, which is part of the path to becoming a better person.\nI ask this question during interview to understand if people are aware of the challenging aspects of working with them and, more importantly, if they are actively working to improve those situations. However, let me share mine.\nWhen I feel frustrated, my lack of trust and patience becomes evident in my work relationships, sometimes to the extent that it can affect the teams I work with and my leadership. In extreme cases, this frustration manifests as cynical behavior, typically directed at leadership after prolonged frustration from stagnation. I often mask it with dark humor, but I find relief through meditation and running to clear my mind of these thoughts. I encourage those working with me to call me out if they notice such behavior.\nInitially, these raw comments might seem brave, bold, or even revealing of some truth. However, they are often negative and lack actionable steps to steer things in the right direction, merely reflecting my frustration. Over time, this repetitive behavior drains people\u0026rsquo;s energy and leads them to view me as irritating and uncooperative.\nThe most troubling aspect of this weakness, and the reason I\u0026rsquo;m actively working on it, is that it contradicts who I aspire to be. My goal is to be a kind and empathetic leader, yet these frustrations lead to behaviors that directly oppose this goal. They put me in a position where my relationships are laden with negative thoughts, not only impacting how others perceive me but also harming the teams I work with and becoming the subjects of my thoughts.\nI\u0026rsquo;m working hard to ensure this doesn\u0026rsquo;t become a defining part of my identity, or at least not for prolonged periods. I acknowledge that some aspects of life or work are beyond my control, and frustration is inevitable. Nevertheless, I am committed to maintaining kindness and empathy even during these challenging times.\nUltimately, it\u0026rsquo;s acceptable to have weaknesses and actively work on improving them. If you believe you have none, it\u0026rsquo;s likely because you haven\u0026rsquo;t deeply reflected on it. None of us are perfect. By acknowledging weaknesses, we can minimize their impact. In the next interview, offering a concrete example of your weaknesses can provide the interviewer a glimpse into your growth journey toward becoming a better person.\nThe next time you have a moment for introspection, ask yourself about the most challenging aspect of working with you and what steps you can take to improve it. However, you must genuinely desire to uncover these answers by being open and honest with yourself.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/weakness/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What are your weaknesses?\u0026quot;—One of the most mocked questions in the interview process.

However, during the promotion cycle, your manager gave you feedback that for you to get promoted you need to grow others around you. This statement might have puzzled you, since when has your performance as an individual contributor had anything to do with other people? It is called the Individual Contributor path for a reason, no?\nWhile you may excel in your technical skills and abilities, it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember that most software engineering positions involve working with a team. Collaboration between developers, product managers, and designers can lead to better products and make you a valuable member of the team.\nTeamwork Series We can define Software Engineering as the union of people, processes, and products to enable the continuous delivery of value to our end users. There can be no promotion if the team does not grow with it.\n\u0026ldquo;Teamwork\u0026rdquo; is a series of posts where I will be sharing my learnings from topics surrounding working with teams like Team Cohesion, Coaching and Mentoring, Delegating and Sponsoring, and others from the perspective of an Engineering Manager. These tools will allow you to support and lead your tech team grow with you.\nTeam Cohesion In my first post, I will be talking about Team Cohesion especially working on agile development. Teamwork plays a crucial role in agile, an approach to software development that emphasizes continuous delivery, iterative development, and the ability to quickly respond to change.\nIn an agile team, everyone works together closely to create high-quality software products. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, teamwork and collaboration are one of the top skills that employers look for in job candidates. Therefore, to achieve success as a Software Engineer, you need to work well with others.\nFor everyone working together, team members need to click like pieces of a clock to move the arms in sync. But we are all different. We have different backgrounds, different personalities, and different ways of working. But, we need to find a way to coordinate our efforts in a direction that works for everyone despite our different strengths and weaknesses including unique ways of communicating, learning, and growing.\nWhat can the team do? There are times when team members might not be able to work together as a team. This is where the role of an Engineering Manager comes in. The Engineering Manager is responsible for ensuring that the team is working together effectively and efficiently. One of the most important skills that an Engineering Manager needs to have is to build team cohesion. Team cohesion is the degree to which team members are attracted to, motivated by, and committed to the team. It is the glue that holds the team together, and the reason why people stay in a team and work together to achieve a common goal. Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about some of the tools that could help you build team cohesion.\nTeam user manual One of the tools that an Engineering Manager can use to build team cohesion is the team user manual. The team user manual is a document that describes the team\u0026rsquo;s culture, values, and processes. It is a living document that is constantly updated and improved, and It is shared with all team members and stakeholders. It is a document that is used to onboard new team members and to help them understand the team\u0026rsquo;s culture and processes.\nThe process of building one requires the inclusion of all team members, and how do we achieve it? We need to start by asking all team members to write their user manuals. The manual describes the team member\u0026rsquo;s preferred way of working, communicating, learning, and growing. If you want to see an example of one, here is mine.\nOnce all team members have written their user manuals, the Engineering Manager needs to review them and consolidate them into one document. The document should be shared with all team members and stakeholders. It is important to note that the team user manual is not a static document. It is a living document that is constantly updated and improved.\nWe can describe the team user manual as the common set of rules that the team members follow to work together effectively and efficiently without stepping on each other\u0026rsquo;s toes or forcing others to change their ways of working. It deletes bias from leadership and includes everyone in the process of building the team.\nTeam Charter Another tool that an Engineering Manager can use to build team cohesion is the team charter. The team charter is a document that describes the team\u0026rsquo;s mission, vision, and values. It is another living document that is constantly updated and improved, and It is shared with all team members and stakeholders. The team charter is built with the input of the 3 main users of a team: the team members, the stakeholders, and the customers.\nThe sections of this document include the purpose of the team, the team\u0026rsquo;s mission statement, the team\u0026rsquo;s values, and the engineering principles to follow in the software engineering process. It should describe who are the customers and the market research done to understand their needs. You can also include the structure of the team and relevant information like the team user manual.\nFinally, it roadmaps the strategy and the actions the team will take in the next 3 to 6 months to solve these needs. One of the most efficient ways to drive this effort is with the Object Key Results methodology.\nThis document is a living document that is constantly updated and improved when any of its parts pivots or there are new learnings from the customers. It is a document that is used to onboard new team members and to help them understand the team\u0026rsquo;s mission, vision, and values. It is also used to communicate with stakeholders and customers about the team\u0026rsquo;s strategy and the actions the team will take. The Team Charter connects the stakeholders, the customers, and the team members on a common goal.\nTeam Roadmap Now that we know the rules of the team and the team\u0026rsquo;s purpose, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the product that they build. To build cohesion in the team, the team members need to know what they are working on and what they are planning to do next. We split this into blocks of work called sprints.\nThis is where the team roadmap comes in. The team roadmap is a document that describes the team\u0026rsquo;s product strategy and the actions the team will take in the next release to improve the product they are working on.\nWith the roadmap, we can estimate the amount of work the team will be able to deliver for each sprint. We can also estimate the amount of time it will take to deliver the features. It also helps the stakeholders to understand the team\u0026rsquo;s progress and to know what they can expect from the team in the next release.\nAt any given moment every team member can read the roadmap and understand the priorities the team has and what is the next most valuable thing to work on. The roadmap also helps the leadership of the team surface any blockers or risks that might prevent the team from delivering the features on time. It also helps them set confidence levels for the team\u0026rsquo;s progress.\nEffective Communication Something worst than not collaborating is collaborating poorly. Effective communication is the key to building team cohesion. It is the key to building trust and making sure that everyone is on the same page, and making sure that everyone is working on the most valuable thing to work on.\nWe need to communicate in a way that is clear, concise, and actionable.\nSet clear expectations: Ensure that everyone on the team understands their roles and responsibilities and the expected outcomes. This helps to avoid misunderstandings and ensures that everyone is working towards the same goals.\nFoster an open-door policy: Encourage team members to approach each other with any questions or concerns they may have. Creating a safe environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas is crucial for effective collaboration.\nUse the right communication channels: Different situations call for different communication channels. For example, instant messaging may be more appropriate for quick questions or asynchronous updates, while synchronous meetings may be better for more detailed information and discussions. Utilizing the appropriate communication channels can help to ensure that messages are delivered and received promptly.\nPractice active listening: Communication is a two-way street, and effective listening is just as important as effective speaking. Encourage team members to actively listen to each other, ask clarifying questions, and provide feedback.\nProvide regular updates: Regular check-ins can help to keep everyone informed of the team\u0026rsquo;s progress and any changes in direction. This helps to avoid surprises and allows team members to adjust their work accordingly.\nConclusion In this post, we talked about the importance of team cohesion in agile development. We also talked about the tools that you can use to build team cohesion and grow the team around you. To collaborate effectively we need to understand who we are, how we want to work, what are the most valuable objectives to work on, and how are we going to communicate to update each other. In my next post, I will be talking about Coaching and Mentoring and how to do it effectively. I will also be talking about the different types of coaching and mentoring and how to choose the right one for your team.\nReferences The Agile Manifesto Developing and Sustaining High-Performance Work Teams The 5 Dysfunctions of a Team ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/teamwork-collaboration/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMany times as a Software Engineer you might have realized you grown your toolset of skills and feel you deserve a promotion.
