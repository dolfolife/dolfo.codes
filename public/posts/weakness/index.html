More often than not, individuals use this opportunity to brag or express how much effort they are willing to put in to go the extra mile.\nPeople struggle to provide good answers to this question because they don’t often take the time to sit and think about their weaknesses. Growing involves being aware of these weaknesses, which is part of the path to becoming a better person.\nI ask this question during interview to understand if people are aware of the challenging aspects of working with them and, more importantly, if they are actively working to improve those situations. However, let me share mine.\nWhen I feel frustrated, my lack of trust and patience becomes evident in my work relationships, sometimes to the extent that it can affect the teams I work with and my leadership. In extreme cases, this frustration manifests as cynical behavior, typically directed at leadership after prolonged frustration from stagnation. I often mask it with dark humor, but I find relief through meditation and running to clear my mind of these thoughts. I encourage those working with me to call me out if they notice such behavior.\nInitially, these raw comments might seem brave, bold, or even revealing of some truth. However, they are often negative and lack actionable steps to steer things in the right direction, merely reflecting my frustration. Over time, this repetitive behavior drains people’s energy and leads them to view me as irritating and uncooperative.\nThe most troubling aspect of this weakness, and the reason I’m actively working on it, is that it contradicts who I aspire to be. My goal is to be a kind and empathetic leader, yet these frustrations lead to behaviors that directly oppose this goal. They put me in a position where my relationships are laden with negative thoughts, not only impacting how others perceive me but also harming the teams I work with and becoming the subjects of my thoughts.\nI’m working hard to ensure this doesn’t become a defining part of my identity, or at least not for prolonged periods. I acknowledge that some aspects of life or work are beyond my control, and frustration is inevitable. Nevertheless, I am committed to maintaining kindness and empathy even during these challenging times.\nUltimately, it’s acceptable to have weaknesses and actively work on improving them. If you believe you have none, it’s likely because you haven’t deeply reflected on it. None of us are perfect. By acknowledging weaknesses, we can minimize their impact. In the next interview, offering a concrete example of your weaknesses can provide the interviewer a glimpse into your growth journey toward becoming a better person.\nThe next time you have a moment for introspection, ask yourself about the most challenging aspect of working with you and what steps you can take to improve it. However, you must genuinely desire to uncover these answers by being open and honest with yourself.\n",
