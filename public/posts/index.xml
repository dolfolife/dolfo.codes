      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello There. I have been thinking in sharing my thoughts. I do not consider myself a good writer nor a good software engineer, but I like to sit in silence and think about what I do. I hope you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many times as a Software Engineer you might have realized you grown your toolset of skills and feel you deserve a promotion. However, during the promotion cycle, your manager gave you feedback that for you to get promoted you need to grow others around you. This statement might have puzzled you, since when has your performance as an individual contributor had anything to do with other people? It is called the Individual Contributor path for a reason, no?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Perspective on Test-Driven Development (TDD)</title>
      <link>https://dolfo.codes/posts/test-drive-development/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the realm of software development, Test-Driven Development (TDD) often elicits a spectrum of opinions. Some view it as a hindrance, others as the solution. And, like every extreme opinion about any topic, it is wrong to think in absolutes, we are not Sith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://dolfo.codes/absolutes.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey with TDD began with Kent Beck&amp;rsquo;s book, &amp;ldquo;Test Driven Development by Example,&amp;rdquo; during my Ruby on Rails learning phase. Here, I share my insights, hoping to demystify TDD and its practicality in software development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Weakness</title>
      <link>https://dolfo.codes/posts/weakness/</link>

      <guid>https://dolfo.codes/posts/weakness/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What are your weaknesses?&amp;quot;—One of the most mocked questions in the interview process. People often joke about it and often have nothing interesting to say. More often than not, individuals use this opportunity to brag or express how much effort they are willing to put in to go the extra mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People struggle to provide good answers to this question because they don’t often take the time to sit and think about their weaknesses. Growing involves being aware of these weaknesses, which is part of the path to becoming a better person.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
